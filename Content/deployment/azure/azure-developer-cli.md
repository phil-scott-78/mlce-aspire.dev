description: Learn how to use the Azure Developer CLI as an alternative deployment path for Aspire applications.

The Azure Developer CLI (`azd`) is a developer-oriented command-line tool that can provision Azure resources and deploy applications from your local environment or CI/CD pipelines. It integrates with Aspire by consuming the deployment manifest format to understand your app model and automatically provision the corresponding Azure resources.

> [!TIP] Recommended: aspire deploy
> For new Azure deployments, we recommend using `aspire deploy` directly. It
>   offers a simpler workflow, supports more Azure targets, and doesn't require an
>   intermediate manifest. See [Deploy using the Aspire
>   CLI](/deployment/azure/aca-deployment-aspire-cli).

## When to use azd

While `aspire deploy` is the recommended path, `azd` remains useful in several scenarios:

- You have **existing `azd` workflows** and infrastructure templates you want to continue using.
- You need **`azd pipeline config`** for automated CI/CD setup with GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps.
- You want to use **`azd` environment management** features to manage multiple deployment environments.
- You're working with **teams already familiar** with `azd` conventions and tooling.

## Prerequisites

- [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) installed
- An active Azure subscription — [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
- [Aspire CLI](/docs/get-started/setup-and-tooling/install-cli) installed

## Basic workflow

<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
**Initialize your project** — run `azd init` from your AppHost directory. When prompted, select **Use code in the current directory** so `azd` detects the Aspire app model.

```bash title="Initialize azd in the AppHost directory"
azd init
```

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
**Provision and deploy** — run `azd up` to provision the required Azure resources and deploy your application in a single step. This combines the `azd provision` and `azd deploy` commands.

```bash title="Provision infrastructure and deploy"
azd up
```

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
**Redeploy without reprovisioning** — after the initial deployment, use `azd deploy` to push code changes without reprovisioning infrastructure.

```bash title="Deploy updated code"
azd deploy
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## `aspire deploy` vs `azd` comparison

| Feature                     | `aspire deploy` | `azd`                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| Azure Container Apps        | ✅              | ✅                    |
| Azure App Service           | ✅              | ❌                    |
| Infrastructure provisioning | Built-in        | Built-in              |
| CI/CD pipeline setup        | Manual          | `azd pipeline config` |
| Environment management      | State caching   | `azd env`             |
| Manifest dependency         | No              | Yes                   |

## Resource naming

The `aspire deploy` path and `azd` use different resource naming schemes by default. If you're upgrading from an existing `azd` deployment to `aspire deploy`, use `WithAzdResourceNaming()` to preserve the original naming convention. This avoids creating duplicate Azure resources:


**C#**


```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment("env")
    .WithAzdResourceNaming();
```


**TypeScript**


```typescript title="apphost.ts"

const builder = await createBuilder();

const env = await builder.addAzureContainerAppEnvironment('env');
await env.withAzdResourceNaming();
```


## Deployment manifest

The `azd` tool relies on the [deployment manifest format](/deployment/azure/manifest-format) to understand your application topology. The manifest is a JSON document generated from the AppHost that describes resources, bindings, and parameters. It's produced automatically when `azd` invokes the AppHost during deployment.

> [!CAUTION]
> The deployment manifest format is deprecated and no longer being evolved. New
>   features and deployment targets are delivered through the `aspire deploy`
>   path. See [Deploy using the Aspire
>   CLI](/deployment/azure/aca-deployment-aspire-cli).
