Aspire separates the act of _producing deployment assets_ from _executing a deployment_. The Aspire CLI (`aspire`) provides two high-level entrypoints:

- `aspire publish`: Generates intermediate, parameterized assets for one or more hosting integrations that implement publish semantics.
- `aspire deploy`: Executes a deployment (when an integration implements deploy semantics) by resolving parameters and applying changes to a target environment.

These commands provide direct access to publishing and deployment capabilities. The actual behavior (what gets generated, how deployment happens) comes from **hosting integrations** you reference (for example: Docker, Kubernetes, Azure). The system is **extensible**—you can build your own publishing or deployment integrations that plug into the same model.

The `aspire publish` command produces deployment artifacts that contain unresolved parameters (placeholders). The `aspire deploy` command uses these artifacts, resolves the parameters when supported by the target integration, and then executes the deployment. Some integrations don't support the `deploy` command.

## Aspire CLI commands (conceptual behavior)

| Command | What it does | Outputs | Parameter state | Requires integration capability |
|---------|--------------|---------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| [`aspire publish`](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-publish) | Transforms the application model into integration-specific assets (Compose files, manifests, specifications, etc.). | Intermediate artifacts (not directly production-final). | Unresolved (placeholders, e.g. `${VAR}` or similar). | Publish support |
| [`aspire deploy`](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-deploy) | Runs a deployment using one or more integrations (build, parameter resolution, apply). | Real resources / applied changes. | Resolved. | Deploy support |

If an integration does not implement deploy functionality, `aspire deploy` will not deploy that target (it may warn or no-op for it).

When you run `aspire publish` without any integrations that support publishing, you'll see:

```plaintext title="Error: No publish support"
Step 1: Analyzing model.

       ✗ FAILED: Analyzing the distributed application model for publishing and deployment capabilities. 00:00:00
       No resources in the distributed application model support publishing.

❌ FAILED: Analyzing model. completed with errors
```

Similarly, when you run `aspire deploy` without any integrations that support deployment, you'll see this error:

```plaintext title="Error: No deploy support"
Step 1: Analyzing model.

       ✗ FAILED: Analyzing the distributed application model for publishing and deployment capabilities. 00:00:00
       No resources in the distributed application model support deployment.

❌ FAILED: Analyzing model. completed with errors
```

These messages indicate that you need to add hosting integrations to your AppHost project. Hosting integrations are NuGet packages (like [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Docker](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Docker), [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Kubernetes](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Kubernetes), or [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure)) that provide the publishing and deployment capabilities for specific target platforms.

## Parameter placeholders

Published assets intentionally contain placeholders instead of concrete values. For Docker Compose—based publish output, parameterization appears as standard environment variable references. For example, a publish artifact might include:

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  pg:
    image: "docker.io/library/postgres:17.2"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD: "scram-sha-256"
      POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS: "--auth-host=scram-sha-256 --auth-local=scram-sha-256"
      POSTGRES_USER: "postgres"
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "${PG_PASSWORD}"
    ports:
      - "8000:5432"
    networks:
      - "aspire"
  dbsetup:
    image: "${DBSETUP_IMAGE}"
    environment:
      OTEL_DOTNET_EXPERIMENTAL_OTLP_EMIT_EXCEPTION_LOG_ATTRIBUTES: "true"
      OTEL_DOTNET_EXPERIMENTAL_OTLP_EMIT_EVENT_LOG_ATTRIBUTES: "true"
      OTEL_DOTNET_EXPERIMENTAL_OTLP_RETRY: "in_memory"
      ASPNETCORE_FORWARDEDHEADERS_ENABLED: "true"
      HTTP_PORTS: "8001"
      ConnectionStrings__db: "Host=pg;Port=5432;Username=postgres;Password=${PG_PASSWORD};Database=db"
    ports:
      - "8002:8001"
      - "8004:8003"
    depends_on:
      pg:
        condition: "service_started"
    networks:
      - "aspire"
```

Key points:

- `${PG_PASSWORD}` and `${DBSETUP_IMAGE}` (and similar) are *placeholders* in the published asset.
- They are not resolved during `aspire publish`.
- A deployment engine (which could be `aspire deploy`, `docker compose` plus a script exporting variables, CI/CD variable injection, etc.) supplies their values later.
- This keeps secrets and environment-specific values decoupled from generated structure.

Different integrations may use different placeholder conventions (environment variables, tokens, or parameter metadata), but the principle remains: publish preserves *shape*, deploy injects *values*.

## Publisher model and compute environments

Aspire uses a flexible publisher model that distributes publishing behavior across your application graph. Resources support publishing and deployment through annotations.

This design enables hybrid and heterogeneous deployments, where different services within the same app can be deployed to different targets (cloud, edge, local).

### Compute environments

A **compute environment** is a core deployment concept in Aspire that represents a target platform where your application resources will be deployed. Compute environments define how resources should be transformed and what deployment artifacts should be generated. Examples of built-in compute environments include the Azure Container Apps environment and the Docker Compose environment.

**Compute resources** are the runnable parts of your application, such as .NET projects, containers, and executables that need to be deployed to a compute environment.

When you add a compute environment like Docker Compose or Kubernetes, Aspire applies the correct publishing behavior to all compatible compute resources in your app model—no extra configuration needed.

### Multiple environments require disambiguation

If you add multiple compute environments, Aspire needs to know which resource goes where. Compute environments apply their transformations to all applicable compute resources (projects, containers, executables). If more than one environment matches a given resource, Aspire throws an ambiguous environment exception at publish time.

You can resolve this by using `WithComputeEnvironment`:

```csharp title="Program.cs"
var k8s = builder.AddKubernetesEnvironment("k8s-env");
var compose = builder.AddDockerComposeEnvironment("docker-env");

builder.AddProject<Projects.Frontend>("frontend")
    .WithComputeEnvironment(k8s);

builder.AddProject<Projects.Backend>("backend")
    .WithComputeEnvironment(compose);
```

This example shows how you could explicitly map services to different compute environments. For example, a frontend in Kubernetes and a backend in Docker Compose.

## Hosting integration support matrix

| Integration | Target | Publish | Deploy | Notes |
|---------------------|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Docker](/integrations/compute/docker) | Docker / Docker Compose | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Use generated Compose with your own scripts or tooling. |
| [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Kubernetes](/integrations/compute/kubernetes) | Kubernetes | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Apply with `kubectl`, GitOps, or other controllers. |
| [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppContainers](/integrations/cloud/azure/configure-container-apps) | Azure Container Apps | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Full publish and deploy support via `aspire deploy`. |
| [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppService](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-app-service/azure-app-service-get-started) | Azure App Service | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Full publish and deploy support via `aspire deploy`. |

> [!TIP]
> Deploy support is integration-specific. Absence of deploy support means you use the published artifacts with external tooling.

## Typical workflows

<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
### Generate artifacts (any integration)

```bash title="Generate artifacts"
aspire publish -o artifacts/
```

Review the contents of _artifacts/_ (for example: Docker Compose files, Kubernetes manifests, Azure specification documents, etc.).

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
### Run locally (Docker example)

```bash title="Run with Docker Compose"
# Provide or export required environment variables, then:
docker compose -f artifacts/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Missing variables like `PG_PASSWORD` must be set in the shell, an `.env` file, or injected by your chosen runner.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
### Using `aspire deploy`

If an integration supports deployment, you can run:

```bash title="Deploy"
aspire deploy
```

This resolves parameters and applies deployment changes for integrations that support deployment.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Extensibility

The `aspire publish` and `aspire deploy` commands support extensible workflows through the pipeline infrastructure. Custom pipeline steps let you build container images, generate manifests, or perform deployment operations. For more information, see [Building custom deployment pipelines](/deployment/custom-deployments).

## Diagnostics and auditing

Publishing gives you an immutable snapshot of intended structure before secrets appear. You can:

- Diff published outputs between commits.
- Scan for disallowed images or configuration.
- Preserve a record for compliance, then separately record the resolved set applied at deployment time.

## Additional tools

### Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)

[Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/) supports deploying Aspire projects. It can provision infrastructure, manage environments, and coordinate secret/value injection. For new deployments, consider using [`aspire deploy`](/deployment/azure/aca-deployment-aspire-cli) directly, which provides a streamlined experience. You can still incorporate Aspire publish artifacts into `azd` workflows when needed.

## Key takeaways

Publishing comes first, followed by deployment, which separates the structure from the values. The artifacts produced during publishing are parameterized, with resolution occurring later in the process. Specific integrations determine the actual behaviors of publishing and deployment, and the system is designed to be extensible, allowing you to build custom integrations that target new platforms or internal tooling.
