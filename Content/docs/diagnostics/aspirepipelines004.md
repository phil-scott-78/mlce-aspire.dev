> Pipeline output service types and members are for evaluation purposes only and are subject to change or removal in future updates. Suppress this diagnostic to proceed.

This diagnostic warning is reported when using the experimental `IPipelineOutputService` interface and the `PipelineOutputService` implementation. These APIs are part of the Aspire pipeline infrastructure for managing output and temporary directories during deployment operations.

The `IPipelineOutputService` interface provides directory management functionality for Aspire deployment pipelines:

- **Output directories**: Manages the location where deployment artifacts are written
- **Temporary directories**: Provides isolated temporary storage for build operations
- **Resource-specific paths**: Creates subdirectories for individual resources

This API is experimental because the pipeline infrastructure is under active development, and the directory management strategy may evolve based on deployment scenario requirements.

## Example

The following code generates `ASPIREPIPELINES004`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Using IPipelineOutputService
var outputService = builder.Services.BuildServiceProvider().GetRequiredService<IPipelineOutputService>();
var outputDir = outputService.GetOutputDirectory();
var tempDir = outputService.GetTempDirectory();
```

### Related types

- **`IPipelineOutputService`**: Service for managing pipeline output and temporary directories
- **`PipelineOutputService`**: Default implementation managing configured and default paths
- **`GetOutputDirectory()`**: Gets the base output directory for deployment artifacts
- **`GetOutputDirectory(IResource)`**: Gets a resource-specific output subdirectory
- **`GetTempDirectory()`**: Gets the base temporary directory for build artifacts
- **`GetTempDirectory(IResource)`**: Gets a resource-specific temporary subdirectory

## To correct this warning

Suppress the warning with either of the following methods:

- Set the severity of the rule in the _.editorconfig_ file.

  ```ini title=".editorconfig"
  [*.{cs,vb}]
  dotnet_diagnostic.ASPIREPIPELINES004.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/docs/diagnostics/overview/#suppress-in-the-editorconfig-file).

- Add the following `PropertyGroup` to your project file:

  ```xml title="C# project file"
  <PropertyGroup>
      <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPIREPIPELINES004</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

- Suppress in code with the `#pragma warning disable ASPIREPIPELINES004` directive:

  ```csharp title="C# — Suppressing the warning"
  #pragma warning disable ASPIREPIPELINES004
  var outputService = builder.Services.BuildServiceProvider().GetRequiredService<IPipelineOutputService>();
  var outputDir = outputService.GetOutputDirectory();
  #pragma warning restore ASPIREPIPELINES004
  ```
