> Method '{0}' marked with [AspireExport] must be static.

This diagnostic error is reported when a method decorated with the `[AspireExport]` attribute is not declared as `static`. Methods exported to other language runtimes via the Aspire Type Specification (ATS) must be static because they are invoked by the ATS runtime without an object instance.

## Example

The following code generates `ASPIREEXPORT001`:

```csharp title="C# — Integration.cs"
[AspireExport("addRedis")]
public IResourceBuilder<RedisResource> AddRedis(
    IResourceBuilder<IResourceWithEnvironment> builder)
{
    return builder.WithReference(...);
}
```

## To correct this error

Add the `static` modifier to the method:

```csharp title="C# — Integration.cs"
[AspireExport("addRedis")]
public static IResourceBuilder<RedisResource> AddRedis(
    IResourceBuilder<IResourceWithEnvironment> builder)
{
    return builder.WithReference(...);
}
```
