> The `GetHostAddressExpression` method is for evaluation purposes only and is subject to change or removal in future updates. Suppress this diagnostic to proceed.

This diagnostic warning is reported when using the experimental `GetHostAddressExpression` method from the `IComputeEnvironmentResource` interface.

## Example

The following code generates `ASPIRECOMPUTE002`:

```csharp title="C# — Using GetHostAddressExpression"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var computeEnv = builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment("env");

// Accessing GetHostAddressExpression on a compute environment resource
var endpoint = computeEnv.Resource.GetEndpoint("http");
var hostAddress = computeEnv.Resource.GetHostAddressExpression(endpoint);
```

## Understanding GetHostAddressExpression

The `GetHostAddressExpression` method is part of the `IComputeEnvironmentResource` interface and provides a way to retrieve the host address or hostname for a specified endpoint reference as a `ReferenceExpression`.

### Key characteristics

- **Returns host only** — The returned value contains only the hostname or address, without scheme, port, or path information
- **Reference expression** — Returns a `ReferenceExpression` that can be evaluated in different contexts
- **Compute environment specific** — Designed for use with compute environment resources like Azure Container Apps, Kubernetes, or Docker Compose

This method is useful when you need to configure resources with just the hostname rather than a full URL, which is common in scenarios like:

- Configuring service-to-service communication within a compute environment
- Setting up DNS-based service discovery
- Configuring load balancers or ingress controllers

## To suppress this warning

Suppress the warning with either of the following methods:

- Set the severity of the rule in the _.editorconfig_ file.

  ```ini title=".editorconfig"
  [*.{cs,vb}]
  dotnet_diagnostic.ASPIRECOMPUTE002.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/docs/diagnostics/overview/#suppress-in-the-editorconfig-file).

- Add the following `PropertyGroup` to your project file:

  ```xml title="C# project file"
  <PropertyGroup>
      <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPIRECOMPUTE002</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

- Suppress in code with the `#pragma warning disable ASPIRECOMPUTE002` directive:

  ```csharp title="C# — Suppressing the warning"
  var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

  var computeEnv = builder.AddAzureContainerAppEnvironment("env");

  #pragma warning disable ASPIRECOMPUTE002
  var endpoint = computeEnv.Resource.GetEndpoint("http");
  var hostAddress = computeEnv.Resource.GetHostAddressExpression(endpoint);
  #pragma warning restore ASPIRECOMPUTE002
  ```
