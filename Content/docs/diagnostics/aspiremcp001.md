> MCP server types and members are for evaluation purposes only and are subject to change or removal in future updates. Suppress this diagnostic to proceed.

This diagnostic warning is reported when using the experimental `WithMcpServer` extension method and related Model Context Protocol (MCP) server APIs. These APIs enable Aspire tooling to discover and proxy MCP servers exposed by resources.

The following APIs are protected by this diagnostic:

- `WithMcpServer` on `IResourceBuilder<T>` — marks a resource as hosting an MCP server on a specified endpoint.
- `McpServerEndpointAnnotation` — annotation that stores the MCP server endpoint information.

## Example

The following code generates `ASPIREMCP001`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyApi>("api")
    .WithMcpServer();

builder.Build().Run();
```

—or—

The following code uses a custom path and endpoint name:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyApi>("api")
    .WithMcpServer("/sse", endpointName: "https");

builder.Build().Run();
```

## To correct this warning

Suppress the warning with either of the following methods:

- Set the severity of the rule in the _.editorconfig_ file.

  ```ini title=".editorconfig"
  [*.{cs,vb}]
  dotnet_diagnostic.ASPIREMCP001.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/docs/diagnostics/overview/#suppress-in-the-editorconfig-file).

- Add the following `PropertyGroup` to your project file:

  ```xml title="C# project file"
  <PropertyGroup>
      <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPIREMCP001</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

- Suppress in code with the `#pragma warning disable ASPIREMCP001` directive:

  ```csharp title="C# — Suppressing the warning"
  #pragma warning disable ASPIREMCP001
  var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyApi>("api")
      .WithMcpServer();
  #pragma warning restore ASPIREMCP001
  ```
