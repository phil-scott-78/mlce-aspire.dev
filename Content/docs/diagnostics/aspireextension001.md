> Extension debugging support APIs are for evaluation purposes only and are subject to change or removal in future updates. Suppress this diagnostic to proceed.

This diagnostic warning is reported when using experimental extension debugging support APIs in Aspire, including:

- `WithDebugSupport<T, TLaunchConfiguration>` extension method
- `SupportsDebuggingAnnotation`

These APIs are primarily used by integration authors to enable F5 debugging for custom resource types in Visual Studio and other IDEs.

## Example

The following code generates `ASPIREEXTENSION001`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddMyResource("resource")
    .WithDebugSupport(
        processId => new MyLaunchConfiguration { ProcessId = processId },
        "myResourceType");
```

## To correct this warning

Suppress the warning with either of the following methods:

- Set the severity of the rule in the _.editorconfig_ file.

  ```ini title=".editorconfig"
  [*.{cs,vb}]
  dotnet_diagnostic.ASPIREEXTENSION001.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/docs/diagnostics/overview/#suppress-in-the-editorconfig-file).

- Add the following `PropertyGroup` to your project file:

  ```xml title="C# project file"
  <PropertyGroup>
      <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPIREEXTENSION001</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```
