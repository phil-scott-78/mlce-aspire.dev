This diagnostic warning is reported when using experimental health probe APIs in Aspire, including:

- `IResourceWithProbes` interface
- `ProbeAnnotation` class and derived types
- `ProbeType` enumeration
- `WithHttpProbe` extension methods
- `EndpointProbeAnnotation` class

These APIs enable configuring HTTP health probes for resources to monitor startup, readiness, and liveness states, similar to Kubernetes health check concepts.

## Example

The following code generates `ASPIREPROBES001`:

```csharp title="C# — Using HTTP probes"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add readiness probe to ensure service is ready before routing traffic
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Readiness, "/health/ready");

// Add liveness probe to detect if service needs restart
var worker = builder.AddProject<Projects.Worker>("worker")
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Liveness, "/health/live");

// Multiple probe types on one resource
var service = builder.AddProject<Projects.Service>("service")
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Startup, "/health/startup",
        initialDelaySeconds: 15, failureThreshold: 10)
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Readiness, "/health/ready",
        periodSeconds: 5, timeoutSeconds: 3)
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Liveness, "/health/live",
        periodSeconds: 30, failureThreshold: 3);

builder.Build().Run();
```

## Understanding health probes

Health probes allow you to configure monitoring for your resources' health state. Aspire supports three types of probes that align with Kubernetes health check concepts:

### Probe types

**`ProbeType.Startup`**

- Determines when the application has started successfully
- Runs during container startup before readiness or liveness probes begin
- Useful for applications with long initialization times
- Typically has higher failure thresholds to allow for startup time

**`ProbeType.Readiness`**

- Determines when the resource is ready to receive traffic
- If the probe fails, traffic is not routed to the resource
- Useful for checking dependencies like database connectivity
- Can temporarily fail without restarting the container

**`ProbeType.Liveness`**

- Detects if the service is still functioning properly
- If the probe fails repeatedly, the resource may be restarted
- Useful for detecting deadlocks or unrecoverable errors
- Should check core application health

### Probe configuration

**`path`** — The HTTP path to probe (default: "/")

**`initialDelaySeconds`** — Delay before the first probe execution (default: 5)

**`periodSeconds`** — Interval between probe executions (default: 5)

**`timeoutSeconds`** — Seconds after which the probe times out (default: 1)

**`failureThreshold`** — Consecutive failures before marking as failed (default: 3)

**`successThreshold`** — Consecutive successes needed to mark as successful after failure (default: 1)

**`endpointName`** — Specific endpoint to probe (optional)

### Custom endpoint targeting

```csharp title="C# — Probe specific endpoint"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Probe specific endpoint by name
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(8080, name: "management")
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Readiness, "/actuator/health",
        endpointName: "management");

// Probe with endpoint selector function
var service = builder.AddProject<Projects.Service>("service")
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Liveness, "/status",
        endpointSelector: () => service.GetEndpoint("https"));

builder.Build().Run();
```

### Integration with resource dependencies

Probes work seamlessly with resource wait dependencies:

```csharp title="C# — Probes with dependencies"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var database = builder.AddPostgres("postgres");
var cache = builder.AddRedis("redis");

// API with probes that check dependencies
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Readiness, "/health/ready")
    .WaitFor(database)
    .WaitFor(cache)
    .WithReference(database)
    .WithReference(cache);

// Frontend waits for API to be ready (not just started)
var frontend = builder.AddProject<Projects.Frontend>("frontend")
    .WaitFor(api)  // Waits for API readiness probe to pass
    .WithReference(api);

builder.Build().Run();
```

## Deployment integration

Probes are automatically configured when deploying to supported compute environments:

- **Azure Container Apps** — Probes are translated to Container Apps health probes
- **Kubernetes** — Probes are mapped to Kubernetes liveness, readiness, and startup probes
- **Docker Compose** — Health checks are configured based on probe settings

## To suppress this warning

Suppress the warning with either of the following methods:

- Set the severity of the rule in the _.editorconfig_ file.

  ```ini title=".editorconfig"
  [*.{cs,vb}]
  dotnet_diagnostic.ASPIREPROBES001.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/docs/diagnostics/overview/#suppress-in-the-editorconfig-file).

- Add the following `PropertyGroup` to your project file:

  ```xml title="C# project file"
  <PropertyGroup>
      <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPIREPROBES001</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

- Suppress in code with the `#pragma warning disable ASPIREPROBES001` directive:

  ```csharp title="C# — Suppressing the warning"
  var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

  #pragma warning disable ASPIREPROBES001
  var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
      .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Readiness, "/health/ready")
      .WithHttpProbe(ProbeType.Liveness, "/health/live");
  #pragma warning restore ASPIREPROBES001

  builder.Build().Run();
  ```
