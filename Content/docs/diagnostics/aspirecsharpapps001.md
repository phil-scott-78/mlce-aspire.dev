> `AddCSharpApp` is for evaluation purposes only and is subject to change or removal in future updates. Suppress this diagnostic to proceed.

Aspire provides a way to add C# app resources to the Aspire AppHost with the `AddCSharpApp` extension. This allows you to reference C# file-based app files (.cs), project files (.csproj), or project directories (directories containing a .csproj file) directly without needing a `ProjectReference` from the AppHost project to the C# application. Since the shape of this API is expected to change in the future, it's experimental.

## Example

The following code generates `ASPIRECSHARPAPPS001`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache");

builder.AddCSharpApp("worker", "../worker/Program.cs")
    .WithReference(cache);

builder.Build().Run();
```

## To correct this error

Suppress the error with either of the following methods:

- Set the severity of the rule in the _.editorconfig_ file.

  ```ini title=".editorconfig"
  [*.{cs,vb}]
  dotnet_diagnostic.ASPIRECSHARPAPPS001.severity = none
  ```

  For more information about editor config files, see [Configuration files for code analysis rules](/docs/diagnostics/overview/#suppress-in-the-editorconfig-file).

- Add the following `PropertyGroup` to your project file:

  ```xml title="C# project file"
  <PropertyGroup>
      <NoWarn>$(NoWarn);ASPIRECSHARPAPPS001</NoWarn>
  </PropertyGroup>
  ```

- Suppress in code with the `#pragma warning disable ASPIRECSHARPAPPS001` directive.
