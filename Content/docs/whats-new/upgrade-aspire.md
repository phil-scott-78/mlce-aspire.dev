Upgrading Aspire involves updating the **Aspire CLI** itself, the **Aspire SDK**, and all related **packages** in your solution. The `aspire update` command handles most of this for you, but you may also need to review breaking changes and update tooling extensions.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're new to Aspire, there's no reason to upgrade anything. See [prerequisites](/docs/get-started/setup-and-tooling/prerequisites) and [install Aspire CLI](/docs/get-started/setup-and-tooling/install-cli) to get started.

## Upgrade with the Aspire CLI


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
**Update the Aspire CLI** to the latest version:

```bash title="Update the Aspire CLI"
aspire update --self
```

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
**Update your Aspire solution** by running:

```bash title="Update your Aspire solution"
aspire update
```

This command automatically:

- Updates the [`Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` version](/docs/app-host/project-structure/aspire-sdk)
- Updates all Aspire NuGet packages to the latest version
- Supports both regular projects and Central Package Management (CPM)

</Step>
</Steps>

## Update the VS Code extension (optional)

If you have the Aspire extension installed, you can update it to get the latest tooling support:


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
Open VS Code

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
Go to **Extensions** ()

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
Search for **Aspire**

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="4">
Click **Update** if an update is available

</Step>
</Steps>

## Remove the legacy workload (Aspire 8 only)

Still rocking the Aspire workload? No judgment here—we've all been there. 🕰️ Time to let it go and join us in the future!

> [!TIP]
> This step is only needed if you're upgrading from Aspire 8. If you're already on Aspire 9 or later, you're good.

Please remove the **aspire workload** with the following command:

```bash 
dotnet workload uninstall aspire
```

## Verify the upgrade

After upgrading, run your application to ensure everything works as expected:

```bash title="Run the Aspire application"
aspire run
```
