## 🆙 Upgrade to Aspire 13.2

<span id="upgrade-to-aspire-13-2"></span>
<br/>

> [!CAUTION]
> Aspire 13.2 includes breaking changes to configuration files, resource
>   commands, event handling, and the Azure AI Foundry (now Microsoft Foundry) integration. Please
>   review the [Breaking changes](#breaking-changes) section before upgrading.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are on a version of the Aspire CLI less than 13, please use the
>   [installation instructions](/docs/get-started/setup-and-tooling/install-cli) to install the latest
>   stable version.

For general purpose upgrade guidance, see [Upgrade Aspire](/docs/whats-new/upgrade-aspire).

The easiest way to upgrade to Aspire 13.2 is using the `aspire update` command:

> [!TIP]
> The `aspire update` command is currently in preview.


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
Update the Aspire CLI:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Update the CLI"
aspire update --self
```

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
Update your Aspire apphost using the [`aspire update` command](/reference/cli/commands/aspire-update):

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Update all Aspire packages"
aspire update
```

</Step>
</Steps>

Or install the CLI from scratch:

You can also manually update your apphost to reference Aspire version `13.2.0`:


**C# AppHost**


```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
#:package Aspire.AppHost.Sdk@13.2.0
```


If you're using a C# apphost, you can then upgrade both your hosting and client integrations via NuGet.

If you're using a TypeScript apphost, run `aspire restore` after upgrading so the integration SDKs are regenerated.

## 🛠️ CLI enhancements

Aspire 13.2 introduces a wave of new CLI commands that dramatically expand what you can do from the terminal. The CLI now exposes all of the data that was previously trapped inside the dashboard and apphost, making it accessible from scripts, editors, and automation workflows.

### Language-specific templates and multi-language setup

Aspire 13.2 makes the `aspire new` (creates a full starter template) and `aspire init` (creates only an apphost) experiences much more language-aware. The CLI now has options to scaffold language-specific full stack starter apps for C#, TypeScript, Python, and both C# and TypesScript apphosts. Use `aspire new` to create a new project from a template, or `aspire init` to add Aspire to an existing project.

The new `aspire restore` command complements this workflow. For C# apphosts it restores the integration NuGet packages, and for TypeScript apphosts it regenerates the integration SDK code and required artifacts. This automatically happens on `aspire run`, but is also now exposed manually.

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Templates and restore"
# Create a new starter with the interactive template picker
aspire new

# Or, create a new blank apphost in an existing codebase
aspire init

# Restores integration packages and starts the apphost
aspire run

# Manually restore integrations
aspire restore
```

### Detached mode and process management

One of the most requested features lands in 13.2: **detached mode** for running Aspirified apps. You can now run your apphost in the background, freeing up your terminal for other tasks.

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Detached mode and process management"
# Run in detached mode
aspire run --detach

# Shorthand command for run --detach
aspire start

# List all running apphosts
aspire ps

# Stop a running apphost in the background
aspire stop
```

The `aspire ps` command displays all currently running Aspire apphosts, making it easy to manage multiple projects simultaneously. When combined with `aspire stop`, you have full control over your application lifecycle directly from the command line.

The new `aspire start` shortcut makes background apphost startup easier to remember, and `aspire stop` can stop a selected apphost or all running apphosts. In JSON mode, `aspire ps` can include resources, which makes it a solid building block for automation and editor integrations.

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Extended operations"
aspire start --apphost .\MyApp.AppHost\MyApp.AppHost.csproj
aspire ps --resources --format json
aspire stop --all
```

Resource commands were also reorganized into the `aspire resource <resource> <command>` form. Built-in commands such as `start`, `stop`, and `restart` now line up more naturally with what the dashboard exposes, and project resources can expose richer commands such as `rebuild`.

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Resource commands"
aspire resource api restart
aspire resource api rebuild
```

> [!TIP]
> For automation and CI/CD scenarios, use `--format Json` to get machine-readable output:
> 
> ```bash title="Aspire CLI — Detached mode with JSON output"
> aspire run --detach --format Json
> aspire ps --format Json
> ```

### Isolated mode for parallel development

The new `--isolated` flag runs an apphost with randomized ports and isolated user secrets, preventing port conflicts and configuration collisions:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Isolated mode"
aspire run --isolated
aspire start --isolated
```

This is especially useful for agentic workflows, git worktrees, and integration tests where multiple instances of the same apphost need to run side by side.

### Resource monitoring with `aspire describe`

The new `aspire describe` command gives you and your coding agents CLI access to the same detailed resource information you get in the Aspire dashboard. You can inspect resource state, configuration, environment variables, health status, and more—all from the terminal.

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Describe resources"
# Show all resources in a running apphost
aspire describe

# Continuously stream resource state changes
aspire describe --follow
```

### Environment diagnostics with `aspire doctor`

The new `aspire doctor` command provides comprehensive diagnostics of your development environment:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Environment diagnostics"
aspire doctor
```

This command checks:

- HTTPS development certificate status (including detection of multiple certificates)
- Container runtime (Docker/Podman) availability and version
- Container tunnel requirements for Docker Engine
- .NET SDK installation and version
- WSL2 environment configuration
- Agent configuration status (detecting deprecated settings)

Not all checks appear in every run. Some checks, such as WSL2 configuration and agent configuration status, are conditional and only appear when the relevant environment or issues are detected.

The output provides actionable recommendations when issues are detected, making it easier to troubleshoot configuration problems.

### Enhanced `aspire add` with fuzzy search

Finding the right integration package is now easier with fuzzy search in the `aspire add` command. Simply start typing and the CLI will suggest matching packages, reducing the friction of discovering and adding new integrations to your project. This release also improves friendly-name generation and better respects NuGet central package management for C# apps.

### New CLI commands for certificates, exports, secrets, and resource lifecycles

Aspire 13.2 significantly expands the day-to-day CLI surface area with several new commands.

Certificate and parameter/secret management get first-class commands:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Certificate and secret management"
aspire certs clean
aspire certs trust

aspire secret set ApiKey super-secret-value
aspire secret list --format json
```

`aspire certs` helps you clean stale developer certificates and trust the current certificate, while `aspire secret` gives apphost [user secrets](/docs/fundamentals/configuration/external-parameters/#secret-values) their own dedicated CLI workflow for setting, reading, listing, locating, and deleting secret values. These are the same secret values that back [`AddParameter(..., secret: true)`](/docs/fundamentals/configuration/external-parameters) calls in the app model—`aspire secret set` writes to the user-secrets store so you no longer need have the .NET CLI installed to manage them via `dotnet user-secrets`.

Two new operational commands round out the experience:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Wait and export"
aspire wait api --status healthy --timeout 120
aspire export --output .\artifacts\aspire-export.zip
```

Use `aspire wait` to block automation until a resource becomes `healthy`, `up`, or `down`, and use `aspire export` to capture telemetry and resource data from a running apphost into a zip file. You can also scope export to a single resource with `aspire export <resource>`.

### Agent integration (`aspire agent`)

The `aspire mcp` command has been renamed to `aspire agent` to better reflect its purpose of managing AI agent integrations. It's also been updated to add Aspire specific SKILL.md files into your repo. The new command structure includes:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Agent integration"
# Initialize agent environment configuration including MCP and skills
aspire agent init

# Manually start the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server - only
aspire agent mcp
```

This enables AI agents to interact with your Aspire applications through a standardized protocol, opening up new possibilities for AI-assisted development workflows.

### Documentation commands from the CLI (`aspire docs`)

The new `aspire docs` command brings the official [aspire.dev](https://aspire.dev) documentation directly into your terminal. Built on the same [MCP (Model Context Protocol) documentation tools](https://davidpine.dev/posts/aspire-docs-mcp-tools/) that power the Aspire agent integration, these commands let you browse, search, and read documentation without leaving your development workflow.

> [!NOTE]
> These commands are intended for use by AI agents; although developers can use these directly, they aren't ergonomic for manual use and the website is still the best place to access documentation.

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Browse and search documentation"
# List all available documentation pages
aspire docs list

# Search for specific topics
aspire docs search "redis"

# Read a full documentation page by its slug
aspire docs get redis-integration

# Read a specific section of a page
aspire docs get redis-integration --section "Add Redis resource"
```

Each command supports `--format Json` for machine-readable output, making them useful for scripting and automation. The `aspire docs search` command also accepts a `--limit` option to control the number of results returned.

### Improved configuration management

The `aspire config` command has been enhanced with better organization:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Configuration management"
# List all configuration with organized sections and colors
aspire config list

# List all available feature flags
aspire config list --all

# Get a specific setting
aspire config get <key>

# Set a configuration value
aspire config set <key> <value>
```

Configuration is now clearly separated into local and global settings, with feature flags displayed in an organized manner.

Aspire now also prefers a single `aspire.config.json` file that combines apphost location, language metadata, Aspire SDK version, channel selection, feature flags, launch profiles, and package pins:

```json title="JSON — aspire.config.json"
{
  "appHost": {
    "path": "apphost.ts",
    "language": "typescript/nodejs"
  },
  "sdk": {
    "version": "13.2.0"
  },
  "channel": "stable",
  "profiles": {
    "default": {
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:17000;http://localhost:15000"
    }
  }
}
```

This unified format replaces the older split across `.aspire/settings.json` and `apphost.run.json` and makes TypeScript apphosts much easier to move, inspect, and automate.

#### Auto migration from legacy configuration files

If you have an existing project that uses `.aspire/settings.json` or `apphost.run.json`, the CLI handles migration automatically. The first time you run any `aspire` command (such as `aspire run`) against an existing project, the CLI merges your legacy `.aspire/settings.json` and `apphost.run.json` into a new `aspire.config.json` at the project root. Paths are automatically re-based—for example, an `appHostPath` that was relative to the `.aspire/` directory is adjusted to be relative to the project root. The legacy files are preserved during migration so you can continue using older CLI versions side by side if needed.

Global settings (`globalsettings.json` in your user-level Aspire directory) are also copied to the new `aspire.config.json` format in the same location. No manual steps are required—just update the CLI and run your project as usual.

### CLI option standardization

Several CLI options were standardized for consistency with common CLI conventions:

- **`-v` for `--version`**: The `-v` flag is now a short alias for `--version`, following standard CLI conventions.
- **`--format` descriptions**: The `--format` option description is now standardized to "Output format (Table or Json)." across all commands that support it.
- **`--log-level`/`-l`**: Commands that support log-level filtering now use `--log-level`/`-l` consistently.

### Other CLI improvements

There are plenty of smaller but meaningful CLI improvements in 13.2:

- `aspire run` now supports `--no-build` for cases where you know the apphost artifacts are already up to date.
- `--format json` always sends JSON output to stdout, while status messages are sent to stderr. This ensures human-readable output is kept separate from structured JSON output, allowing scripts and editors that consume JSON to receive well-formed content.
- Tables, status indicators, help organization, logging, and error messages were refined across interactive and non-interactive scenarios.
- The unified self-extracting Aspire CLI bundle continues to improve multi-language experiences, especially when .NET isn't already installed globally.
- Status messages that start with an emoji are consistently aligned. This is harder than you might think! If you see messy CLI output, [please let us know](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire).

## 🧩 VS Code extension

The Aspire VS Code extension received its biggest update yet in 13.2, with over 20 PRs shipping new features that make VS Code a first-class Aspire development environment alongside Visual Studio.

### Aspire Activity Bar panel

A dedicated **Aspire panel** in the Activity Bar gives you a live tree view of running apphosts and their resources. The panel uses `aspire describe --follow` to stream real-time resource state updates for the workspace apphost — no polling, no latency. A workspace/global toggle lets you switch between viewing just the current workspace's apphost or all running apphosts on your machine.

Resources in the tree show health-aware icons (green for healthy, red for errors, amber for degraded, spinner for starting), rich markdown tooltips with type, state, and clickable endpoint URLs, and right-click context menus for common operations like viewing logs, stopping, or restarting resources.

### CodeLens and gutter decorations

When an Aspire apphost is running, the extension now shows **inline CodeLens** above each resource definition in your C# or TypeScript apphost file:

- Live resource state (Running, Starting, Stopped, Error) with health status
- Action buttons: Start, Stop, Restart, View Logs
- Custom resource commands from the runtime

Colored **gutter decorations** appear alongside resource definitions — green for running, blue for starting, red for errors, gray for stopped — giving you an at-a-glance view of your entire app's health right in the editor. Both features are backed by language-aware parsers that understand `DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder` in C# and `createBuilder()` in TypeScript.

### Getting Started walkthrough

A new **Getting Started walkthrough** guides new users through installing the CLI, creating a project, running their app, exploring the dashboard, and next steps — all from within VS Code. The walkthrough includes clickable terminal links to install the Aspire CLI directly from the editor.

### Debugging improvements

- **Azure Functions debugging** — Azure Functions projects referenced from an apphost can now be debugged directly.
- **TypeScript apphost debugging** — TS apphosts now participate in debugging more naturally, with better tool detection, build/launch coordination, and support for browser debugging scenarios.
- **`publish`, `deploy`, and `do` flows** can now be debugged directly from the extension.
- **Apphost exit messages** now appear in the debug console for easier troubleshooting.

### `aspire.config.json` and MCP support

The extension now reads `aspire.config.json` for apphost discovery instead of relying solely on `.csproj` file detection, making TypeScript apphosts work seamlessly. It can also **auto-register the Aspire MCP server** for AI agent workflows. The CLI is automatically detected at default install paths even when it's not on PATH.

### Additional improvements

- A new `enableAspireDashboardAutoLaunch` setting lets you disable automatic dashboard launch on run.
- File pickers replace raw string prompts in more places.
- Right-click context menus on resource endpoint URLs.
- Falls back to `code-insiders` when `code` is not found.

## 🌐 TypeScript AppHost support (preview)

One of the most anticipated features in Aspire 13.2 is support for writing your apphost in TypeScript. The TypeScript AppHost is currently in preview.

### Writing an apphost in TypeScript

TypeScript apphosts use the same app model as C#—resources, references, integrations—expressed in idiomatic TypeScript via `createBuilder()`:

```typescript title="TypeScript — apphost.ts"

const builder = await createBuilder();

const cache = await builder.addRedis("cache");
const api = await builder.addProject("api", "../api")
    .withReference(cache)
    .waitFor(cache);

await builder.build().run();
```

Under the hood, this runs as a guest process alongside Aspire's .NET orchestration host, communicating via JSON-RPC over local transport. Your TypeScript defines the resource graph; the host handles orchestration, health checks, and the dashboard.

### Code generation

When you run `aspire add`, the CLI inspects the integration's .NET assembly and generates a TypeScript SDK into `.modules/`. Running `aspire restore` regenerates these SDKs—useful after upgrading or switching branches (this also runs automatically on `aspire run`).

In 13.2, the code generator gained AspireList support for richer collection handling and now covers Go, Java, and Rust test targets alongside TypeScript.

### Debugging, tooling, and templates

TypeScript apphosts now have first-class support in the VS Code extension—CodeLens, gutter decorations, and debugging all work with `createBuilder()` calls. The `aspire.config.json` format means TypeScript apphosts are discovered automatically without needing a `.csproj`. Templates were also refreshed with updated dependencies and better starter defaults.

## 📊 Dashboard improvements

### Data export and import

Aspire 13.2 adds comprehensive data export and import capabilities to the dashboard. You can bulk-manage telemetry through a centralized dialog, export individual resources and telemetry as JSON, and export environment variables as `.env` files.

#### Manage logs and telemetry dialog

The new **Manage logs and telemetry** dialog (accessible via **Settings → Manage**) is a one-stop shop for exporting, importing, and removing data from the dashboard. Select resources and telemetry types, then export, remove, or import as needed.

Data is exported as JSON in a zip file. Share it with AI, teammates, or import it back into the dashboard later.

![Manage logs and telemetry dialog showing Export selected, Remove selected, and Import logs and telemetry buttons](/assets/whats-new/aspire-13.2/manage-dialog.png)

The dashboard can also import telemetry bundles captured with `aspire export`, making it easy to attach diagnostics to bug reports, preserve a point-in-time view of a session, or share a failing scenario with a teammate.

#### Export JSON for resources and telemetry

Export data for specific resources and telemetry directly from the dashboard. Select **Export JSON** in context menus to get the data — copy it to your clipboard or download it to your machine.

![Export JSON button in the resource context menu](/assets/whats-new/aspire-13.2/export-json-menu.png)

![Export JSON dialog with options to copy to clipboard or download](/assets/whats-new/aspire-13.2/export-json-dialog.png)

#### Export environment variables as `.env` files

Export a resource's environment variables directly to a `.env` file format from the resource details view.

![Export Env dialog showing environment variables exported in .env format](/assets/whats-new/aspire-13.2/export-env-dialog.png)

#### Telemetry HTTP API

The dashboard now exposes an HTTP API for querying telemetry data programmatically. These APIs power the `aspire agent mcp` and `aspire otel` Aspire CLI commands.

The API is served under `/api/telemetry` and returns data in OTLP JSON format. Available endpoints:

- `GET /api/telemetry/resources` — List resources that have telemetry data
- `GET /api/telemetry/spans` — Query spans with optional filters
- `GET /api/telemetry/logs` — Query logs with optional filters
- `GET /api/telemetry/traces` — List traces with optional filters
- `GET /api/telemetry/traces/{traceId}` — Get all spans for a specific trace

The spans and logs endpoints also support real-time streaming via `?follow=true`, which returns NDJSON (newline-delimited JSON) as new telemetry arrives. Multiple resource names can be specified by repeating the `resource` query parameter (e.g. `?resource=api&resource=worker`).

When running with an Aspire apphost, the telemetry API is enabled automatically. For standalone dashboard deployments, set the `DASHBOARD__API__ENABLED` environment variable to `true` and configure authentication with `DASHBOARD__API__AUTHMODE` (`ApiKey` or `Unsecured`) and `DASHBOARD__API__PRIMARYAPIKEY`.

### Set parameters from the dashboard

You can now set resource parameters directly in the dashboard. Click the key action on a parameter and enter a new value. To remember it next time, optionally save the value to your user secrets.

![Dashboard dialog for setting a parameter value with an option to save to user secrets](/assets/whats-new/aspire-13.2/dashboard-set-parameters.png)

### GenAI visualizer improvements

The GenAI visualizer keeps getting sharper. In 13.2 it handles more schema shapes, tolerates truncated payloads more gracefully, properly displays non-ASCII text, and makes tool inspection easier by letting you jump directly from a tool call to the corresponding tool definition.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using Aspire to inspect AI-heavy workloads, these improvements make
>   the dashboard much more useful when traffic is messy, incomplete, or generated
>   by real agents rather than tidy samples.

### Resource graph improvements

The resource graph layout has been significantly improved with adaptive force-directed positioning. Resources with many connections now have more space around them, making complex graphs feel less cluttered.

**After:**

![Resource graph after improvements, showing a cleaner layout with better spacing around highly-connected resources](/assets/whats-new/aspire-13.2/resource-graph-after.png)

### Dashboard UX refinements

Additional dashboard refinements in 13.2:

- Persistent collapsed/expanded state of resources
- A 12-hour or 24-hour time format setting.
- Consistent resource colors across the dashboard and CLI.
- Better JSON viewers for traces, spans, logs, and resources.
- Improved handling for large gRPC payloads.
- More stable graph layout and filtering behavior.
- Base path configuration for reverse proxy scenarios.
- Aggregate replica states—parent resources now show combined state from their replicas.
- More polished dialogs, menus, copy flows, and resource details views.

## 🧩 App model and resource improvements

### MCP endpoints from the app model

Aspire 13.2 adds `WithMcpServer`, which lets you declare in the app model that a resource hosts a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. Aspire tooling can then discover and proxy that endpoint directly.


**C# AppHost**


```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyApi>("api")
    .WithMcpServer("/mcp");

builder.Build().Run();
```


**TypeScript AppHost**


```typescript title="TypeScript — apphost.ts"

const builder = await createBuilder();

const api = await builder.addProject("api", "../api", "https")
    .withMcpServer({ path: "/mcp" });

await builder.build().run();
```


> [!NOTE]
> If you host the MCP server on a non-default endpoint or path, you can pass a
>   custom `path` or `endpointName`.

### Project rebuilds and smarter change detection

.NET Project resources now support a `rebuild` command in addition to the usual lifecycle commands. This gives you a clean way to apply source changes to a single project resource without tearing down the whole apphost session.

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Rebuild a single resource"
aspire resource api rebuild
```

Under the hood, Aspire coordinates stop, build, and restart through a hidden rebuilder resource and improved change detection, so the experience is much closer to "rebuild just this one thing" instead of "restart everything and hope."

### OTLP endpoint as a first-class resource

The OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) endpoint is now modeled as a first-class resource in the application model, making it visible in the dashboard and configurable through standard resource APIs.

### Better secret and certificate handling

Container build secrets got a clearer API in 13.2. `WithBuildSecret` replaces the old `WithSecretBuildArg` name and makes secure Docker or Podman build secret flows more readable.


**C# AppHost**


```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var accessToken = builder.AddParameter("accessToken", secret: true);

builder.AddContainer("worker", "contoso/worker")
    .WithDockerfile("../worker")
    .WithBuildSecret("ACCESS_TOKEN", accessToken);
```


**TypeScript AppHost**


```typescript title="TypeScript — apphost.ts"

const builder = await createBuilder();

const accessToken = await builder.addParameter("accessToken", { secret: true });

await builder.addContainer("worker", "contoso/worker")
    .withDockerfile("../worker")
    .withBuildSecret("ACCESS_TOKEN", accessToken);
```


Certificate trust handling also became more flexible. You can now create custom certificate bundles during run mode, which helps with scenarios like Java trust stores or custom bundle formats that don't map cleanly to the default certificate layout.

```csharp title="C# — Custom certificate trust configuration"
builder.AddContainer("my-java-app", "my-image:latest")
    .WithCertificateTrustConfiguration(ctx =>
    {
        ctx.EnvironmentVariables["JAVAX_NET_SSL_TRUSTSTORE"] =
            ctx.CreateCustomBundle((certs, ct) =>
        {
            var pkcs12Builder = new Pkcs12Builder();
            var safeContents = new Pkcs12SafeContents();

            foreach (var cert in certs)
            {
                safeContents.AddCertificate(cert);
            }

            pkcs12Builder.AddSafeContentsUnencrypted(safeContents);
            pkcs12Builder.SealWithMac(
                string.Empty, HashAlgorithmName.SHA256, 2048);

            return Task.FromResult(pkcs12Builder.Encode());
        });

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    });
```

`ReferenceExpression` now exposes `GetValueAsync()` and supports conditional mode in multi-language code generation, which makes advanced hosting extensions easier to build without relying on synchronous value access patterns.

### Enhanced debugging experience

Several types now include `DebuggerDisplayAttribute` for better debugging:

- `DistributedApplication`
- Resource types
- `EndpointReferenceExpression`
- `ReferenceExpression`
- `PipelineStep`

This makes it easier to inspect your Aspire application state during debugging sessions.

### Resource event improvements

- Added `Logger` property to `IDistributedApplicationResourceEvent` for better logging context
- Improved `ResourceNotificationService.WaitFor` exception messages with more detailed information
- `BeforeResourceStartedEvent` now only fires when actually starting a resource (breaking change)

### Docker and container enhancements

- **'Never' Pull Policy**: Exposed image pull policy option for scenarios requiring local images
- **PullPolicy for Docker Compose**: Added `PullPolicy` property to Docker Compose Service class
- **`.npmrc` in Docker builds**: JavaScript Dockerfiles now copy `.npmrc` before running install, so private registry authentication works correctly in container builds
- **PostgreSQL v18+ Compatibility**: Fixed data volume path for PostgreSQL version 18 and later

### Build improvements

- Build error when `GenerateAssemblyInfo` is disabled in apphost projects
- Trailing commas now allowed in `launchSettings.json`
- JSON comments and trailing commas parsed without errors

### Contextual endpoint resolution

Aspire 13.2 introduces enhanced contextual endpoint resolution APIs that allow you to resolve endpoints from the perspective of specific resources or networks. This enables you to get the correct URL for a resource depending on where you're accessing it from, whether it's from a container, a host service, or a specific network.

The same resource can have different URLs depending on the context:

- From localhost: `http://localhost:1234`
- From a container on the host Docker network: `http://host.docker.internal:1234`
- From a container on the Aspire container network: `http://resource.dev.internal:4567`

#### Resolve from a specific resource (Caller)

You can resolve an endpoint URL from the perspective of a specific calling resource using the `Caller` property on `ValueProviderContext`:

```csharp title="C# — Resolve endpoint from a resource's perspective"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var redis = builder.AddRedis("cache");
var containerApp = builder.AddContainer("worker", "myimage");

// Get the endpoint reference
var endpoint = redis.GetEndpoint("tcp");

// Resolve the URL from the container's perspective
var url = await endpoint.GetValueAsync(new ValueProviderContext {
    Caller = containerApp.Resource,
});

// The URL will be appropriate for container-to-container communication
// e.g., "redis:6379" or "cache:6379"
```

This is particularly useful when you need to pass connection information between resources that may be running in different contexts (containers vs. host processes).

#### Resolve from a specific network

You can also resolve an endpoint URL from the perspective of a specific network using the `Network` property on `ValueProviderContext`:

```csharp title="C# — Resolve endpoint from a network's perspective"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var redis = builder.AddRedis("cache");

// Get the endpoint reference
var endpoint = redis.GetEndpoint("tcp");

// Resolve the URL for the default Aspire container network
var url = await endpoint.GetValueAsync(new ValueProviderContext {
    Network = KnownNetworkIdentifiers.DefaultAspireContainerNetwork
});

// The URL will be appropriate for the container network
// e.g., "cache:6379" using the resource name as the hostname
```

The `KnownNetworkIdentifiers` class provides predefined network identifiers:

- `LocalhostNetwork`: Resolves to localhost-based URLs
- `DefaultAspireContainerNetwork`: Resolves to container network URLs using resource names
- `PublicInternet`: Resolves to externally accessible URLs

> [!NOTE]
> These APIs existed in Aspire 13.1 but did not behave as expected. In Aspire
>   13.2, they now correctly resolve endpoints based on the specified context.

## 📦 Integrations updates

### Docker Compose publishing

The Docker Compose publishing integration has moved from prerelease to a stable release in Aspire 13.2. When you add a Docker Compose environment to your app model, Aspire generates a `docker-compose.yaml` from your resources at publish time, making it easy to deploy your Aspire application to any environment that supports Docker Compose.


**C# AppHost**


```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddDockerComposeEnvironment("compose");

builder.Build().Run();
```


**TypeScript AppHost**


```typescript title="TypeScript — apphost.ts"

const builder = await createBuilder();

await builder.addDockerComposeEnvironment("compose");

await builder.build().run();
```


Aspire generates a complete `docker-compose.yaml` from the resources in your app model, including networking, volumes, and environment variables.

### Microsoft Foundry and hosted agents

Aspire 13.2 replaces the earlier Azure AI Foundry-focused hosting surface with a broader Microsoft Foundry integration. The hosting package is now `Aspire.Hosting.Foundry`, replacing `Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AIFoundry`.

You can now add Foundry accounts, create Foundry Projects, attach model deployments with the generated `FoundryModel` catalog, and publish hosted agents from the regular Aspire app model:


**C# AppHost**


```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("foundry");
var project = foundry.AddProject("agents");

var chat = project.AddModelDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.OpenAI.Gpt5Mini);

builder.AddPythonApp("agent", "..\\agent", "main:app")
    .WithReference(project)
    .WithReference(chat)
    .PublishAsHostedAgent(project);

builder.Build().Run();
```


**TypeScript AppHost**


```typescript title="TypeScript — apphost.ts"

const builder = await createBuilder();

const foundry = await builder.addFoundry("foundry");
const project = await foundry.addProject("agents");

const chat = await project.addModelDeploymentFromModel("chat", {
    name: "gpt-5-mini",
    version: "2025-06-01",
    format: "OpenAI",
});

await builder.addPythonApp("agent", "../agent", "main:app")
    .withReference(project)
    .withReference(chat)
    .publishAsHostedAgent({ project });

await builder.build().run();
```


New APIs in this area include `AddProject`, `AddModelDeployment`, `WithAppInsights`, `WithKeyVault`, `WithContainerRegistry`, `PublishAsHostedAgent`, and `AddAndPublishPromptAgent`. `RunAsFoundryLocal` is still available for local model development, but Foundry Projects aren't supported when the parent resource is configured as Foundry Local.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a breaking change. `Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AIFoundry` has been replaced
>   by `Aspire.Hosting.Foundry`. See the [AIFoundry to Foundry
>   transition](#aifoundry-to-foundry-transition) in breaking changes for
>   migration steps.

### Azure Virtual Network and private endpoint support

When deploying to Azure, securing network access to your resources is critical. The new `Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Network` integration lets you lock down your Azure resources by defining virtual networks, subnets, NAT gateways, network security groups (NSGs), and private endpoints directly in your apphost—ensuring your cloud infrastructure is secure by default.

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var vnet = builder.AddAzureVirtualNetwork("vnet");

// Add a subnet with NSG rules
var subnet = vnet.AddSubnet("web", "10.0.1.0/24")
    .AllowInbound(
        port: "443",
        from: AzureServiceTags.AzureLoadBalancer,
        protocol: SecurityRuleProtocol.Tcp)
    .DenyInbound(from: AzureServiceTags.Internet);

// Add a NAT gateway for deterministic outbound IPs
var natGateway = builder.AddNatGateway("nat");
subnet.WithNatGateway(natGateway);

// Add private endpoints for secure connectivity
var peSubnet = vnet.AddSubnet("private-endpoints", "10.0.2.0/27");
var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage");
peSubnet.AddPrivateEndpoint(storage.AddBlobs("blobs"));
```

Key capabilities include:

- **Virtual networks and subnets**: Create networks with `AddAzureVirtualNetwork` and add subnets with `AddSubnet`.
- **NAT gateways**: Provide deterministic outbound public IP addresses with `AddNatGateway` and `WithNatGateway`.
- **Network security groups**: Control traffic flow using shorthand methods (`AllowInbound`, `DenyInbound`, `AllowOutbound`, `DenyOutbound`) or explicit `AddNetworkSecurityGroup` with `WithSecurityRule` for full control.
- **Private endpoints**: Securely connect to Azure services over private networks with `AddPrivateEndpoint`, which automatically creates private DNS zones, virtual network links, and disables public access on the target resource.

### Azure AI and embedding support

The Azure AI Inference component now supports embeddings in addition to chat completions. You can register an `EmbeddingsClient` and then layer an `IEmbeddingGenerator<string, Embedding<float>>` on top of it:

```csharp title="C# — Service project"
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddAzureEmbeddingsClient("embeddings")
    .AddEmbeddingGenerator();

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/embed", async (
    IEmbeddingGenerator<string, Embedding<float>> generator) =>
{
    var embedding = await generator.GenerateEmbeddingAsync("Hello, world!");
    return embedding.Vector.ToArray();
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> Keyed embeddings are supported too with `AddKeyedEmbeddingGenerator`.

### Azure App Service enhancements

- Deployment slot support with new extension methods
- Sticky slot app settings fixes
- Configuration naming improvements
- `SearchIndexerClient` added as an extension method for Azure Search

### Azure Container Registry

The Azure Container Registry integration now supports scheduled image cleanup with the new `WithPurgeTask` method. This provisions an [ACR purge task](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/container-registry-auto-purge) that automatically removes old or unused container images on a cron schedule:

```csharp title="C# — Schedule ACR image cleanup"
var acr = builder.AddAzureContainerRegistry("my-acr")
    .WithPurgeTask("0 1 * * *", ago: TimeSpan.FromDays(7), keep: 5);
```

Additionally, the new `GetAzureContainerRegistry` method makes it easy to access the registry from a compute environment for further configuration.

### Azure Data Lake Storage integration

Aspire 13.2 adds both hosting and client-side support for Azure Data Lake Storage. This closes an important gap for teams using hierarchical namespace storage and gives Data Lake users the usual Aspire integration benefits: DI registration, retries, health checks, logging, and telemetry.


**C# AppHost**


```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api");
var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage");
var dataLake = storage.AddDataLake("data-lake");
var fileSystem = storage.AddDataLakeFileSystem("data-lake-file-system");

api.WithReference(dataLake)
   .WaitFor(dataLake)
   .WithReference(fileSystem)
   .WaitFor(fileSystem);
```


**TypeScript AppHost**


```typescript title="TypeScript — apphost.ts"

const builder = await createBuilder();

const api = await builder.addProject("api", "../api");
const storage = await builder.addAzureStorage("storage");
const dataLake = await storage.addDataLake("data-lake");
const fileSystem = await storage.addDataLakeFileSystem("data-lake-file-system");

await api.withReference(dataLake)
   .waitFor(dataLake)
   .withReference(fileSystem)
   .waitFor(fileSystem);
```


```csharp title="C# — Service project"
builder.AddAzureDataLakeServiceClient("data-lake");
builder.AddAzureDataLakeFileSystemClient("data-lake-file-system");
```

### Database integrations

- **MongoDB**: Connection string options now correctly prepend forward slash
- **MongoDB Entity Framework Core**: [New client integration `Aspire.MongoDB.EntityFrameworkCore`](/integrations/databases/efcore/mongodb/mongodb-efcore-get-started)
- **Oracle EF Core**: Multi-targeting support added
- **SQL Server**: New `Aspire.Hosting.SqlServer` exports

The new MongoDB EF Core provider makes it easier to use EF Core with MongoDB while keeping the normal Aspire enrichment experience:

```csharp title="C# — Service project"
builder.AddMongoDbContext<MyDbContext>("mongodb", databaseName: "appdb");
```

If you register the `DbContext` yourself, you can still opt into Aspire instrumentation and health features with `EnrichMongoDbContext<TContext>()`.

### JavaScript hosting with Bun

JavaScript resources can now opt into Bun as their package manager with `WithBun()`. Aspire configures the right package-manager annotations, install behavior, and container build image defaults for Bun-backed applications. This release also fixes reliability issues when using Yarn with `AddViteApp` via `WithYarn()`.


**C# AppHost**


```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddViteApp("frontend", "./frontend")
    .WithBun()
    .WithDockerfileBaseImage(buildImage: "oven/bun:latest");

builder.Build().Run();
```


**TypeScript AppHost**


```typescript title="TypeScript — apphost.ts"

const builder = await createBuilder();

await builder.addViteApp("frontend", "./frontend")
    .withBun()
    .withDockerfileBaseImage({ buildImage: "oven/bun:latest" });

await builder.build().run();
```

## ⚠️ Breaking changes

<span id="breaking-changes"></span>

### Service discovery environment variable naming

Service discovery environment variables now use the endpoint **scheme** instead of the endpoint **name**:

```csharp title="C# — Before (13.0/13.1)"
// services__myservice__myendpoint__0 = https://localhost:5001
```

```csharp title="C# — After (13.2)"
// services__myservice__https__0 = https://localhost:5001
```

This improves consistency when endpoints share the same scheme. If you have code or configuration that depends on specific endpoint name patterns in service discovery environment variables, update it to use scheme-based patterns instead.

### Consolidated configuration files

Aspire now prefers `aspire.config.json` over the older split configuration model.

New scaffolds and updated tooling write unified configuration there, and launch profiles that used to live in `apphost.run.json` are merged into the same file. Legacy files are still read during migration, but if you have custom automation that edits `.aspire/settings.json` or `apphost.run.json` directly, plan to move that logic to `aspire.config.json`.

### Resource command rename

Built-in resource commands now use the shorter names `start`, `stop`, and `restart`.

If you scripted command names directly, migrate away from `resource-start`, `resource-stop`, and `resource-restart`:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Updated resource commands"
aspire resource api start
aspire resource api stop
aspire resource api restart
```

> [!NOTE]
> `--apphost` is also now the preferred option name across commands, although
>   the legacy `--project` alias is still accepted for compatibility.

### Dashboard telemetry API now opt-in

The standalone dashboard now defaults its HTTP API to off.

If you host the dashboard directly and rely on the API, enable it explicitly by setting `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_API_ENABLED=true` or by supplying equivalent configuration:

```json title="JSON — Dashboard configuration"
{
  "Dashboard": {
    "Api": {
      "Enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> AppHost-integrated dashboard scenarios continue to work because Aspire.Hosting
>   enables the dashboard API when it wires the dashboard up for CLI and tooling
>   integration.

### `BeforeResourceStartedEvent` behavior

The `BeforeResourceStartedEvent` now only fires when actually starting a resource, not on every state change. Update your event handlers if they rely on the previous behavior.

### Connection property suffix

A connection property suffix has been added which may require updates to code that accesses connection properties directly.

### AIFoundry to Foundry transition

`Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AIFoundry` was replaced by the broader `Aspire.Hosting.Foundry` surface.

When upgrading, make both of these changes:

- Replace the `Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AIFoundry` package reference with `Aspire.Hosting.Foundry`.
- Migrate from `AddAzureAIFoundry()` to `AddFoundry()`, then add deployments explicitly with `AddDeployment()` or `AddModelDeployment()`.

```xml title="XML — AppHost project file"
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Aspire.Hosting.Foundry" Version="13.2.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

```csharp title="C# — Migration example"
// Before
var ai = builder.AddAzureAIFoundry("ai");

// After
var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("ai");
var project = foundry.AddProject("agents");
var chat = project.AddModelDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.OpenAI.Gpt5Mini);
```

This aligns the hosting API with the current Foundry branding and unlocks the new project, deployment, and hosted-agent capabilities added in new Microsoft Foundry releases.

### `WithSecretBuildArg` renamed to `WithBuildSecret`

The container build secret API was renamed for clarity:

```csharp title="C# — Migration example"
// Before
builder.AddContainer("worker", "contoso/worker")
    .WithDockerfile("../worker")
    .WithSecretBuildArg("ACCESS_TOKEN", accessToken);

// After
builder.AddContainer("worker", "contoso/worker")
    .WithDockerfile("../worker")
    .WithBuildSecret("ACCESS_TOKEN", accessToken);
```

If you only used the old name through shared helpers or extension methods, this is usually a straightforward rename.

### `IAzureContainerRegistry` obsolete

The `IAzureContainerRegistry` interface has been marked as obsolete. Use the new `ContainerRegistry` property on compute environments instead.

### Default Azure credential behavior in client integrations

Aspire Azure client integrations no longer use the parameterless `DefaultAzureCredential` constructor. This is a breaking change for anyone depending on credentials other than `ManagedIdentityCredential` working in an Azure service. For more information on the new behavior, see [Default Azure credential](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-default-credential).
