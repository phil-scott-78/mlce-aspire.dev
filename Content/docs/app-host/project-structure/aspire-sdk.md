The Aspire SDK is intended for [AppHost projects](/docs/fundamentals/core-concepts/app-host), which serve as the orchestrator for Aspire applications. These projects are designated by their usage of the `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` in the project file. The SDK provides features that simplify the development of Aspire apps.

The [📦 Aspire.AppHost.Sdk](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.AppHost.Sdk) is used for building Aspire apps.


**Project file**

The `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` is defined in the top-level `Project` node's `Sdk` attribute:

```xml title='XML — *.csproj file' {1}
<Project Sdk="Aspire.AppHost.Sdk/13.1">

    <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
        <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>
        <!-- Omitted for brevity -->
    </PropertyGroup>

    <!-- Omitted for brevity -->
</Project>
```


**File-based app**


The `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk` is defined in a file-based app's source file using the `#:sdk` directive:

```csharp title='C# — file-based app' {1}
#:sdk Aspire.AppHost.Sdk@13.1.0

var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Omitted for brevity
```


The preceding example defines the top-level SDK as `Aspire.AppHost.Sdk`. The project also references the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.AppHost](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.AppHost) package which brings in a number of Aspire-related dependencies.

## SDK Features

The Aspire SDK provides several key features.

### Project references

Each `ProjectReference` in the AppHost project isn't treated as standard project references. Instead, they enable the AppHost to execute these projects as part of its orchestration. Each project reference triggers a generator to create a `class` that represents the project as an `IProjectMetadata`. This metadata is used to populate the named projects in the generated `Projects` namespace. When you call the `AddProject` API, the `Projects` namespace is used to reference the project—passing the generated class as a generic-type parameter.

> [!TIP]
> To prevent a project from being treated as an Aspire resource in the AppHost, set the `IsAspireProjectResource` attribute on the `ProjectReference` element to `false`, as shown in the following example:
> 
> ```xml
> <ProjectReference Include="..\MyProject\MyProject.csproj" IsAspireProjectResource="false" />
> ```
> 
> Otherwise, by default, the `ProjectReference` is treated as Aspire project resource.

#### Customizing generated project names

When you reference a project in the AppHost, the Aspire SDK generates a strongly-typed class in the `Projects` namespace. By default, the generated class name is based on the project's name. However, if you have multiple projects with the same name or want to customize the generated type name, you can use the `AspireProjectMetadataTypeName` attribute.

For example, if you have two microservices with the same project name (like `Presentation.Api`), you can differentiate them by setting custom names:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <ProjectReference Include="..\Microservice1\Presentation.Api\Presentation.Api.csproj"
                    AspireProjectMetadataTypeName="MicroService1" />
  <ProjectReference Include="..\Microservice2\Presentation.Api\Presentation.Api.csproj"
                    AspireProjectMetadataTypeName="MicroService2" />
</ItemGroup>
```

This generates `Projects.MicroService1` and `Projects.MicroService2` classes, allowing you to reference each project distinctly in your AppHost:

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
var microservice1 = builder.AddProject<Projects.MicroService1>("micro1");
var microservice2 = builder.AddProject<Projects.MicroService2>("micro2");
```

### Orchestrator dependencies

The Aspire SDK dynamically adds references to the [Aspire dashboard](/dashboard/overview) and other AppHost dependencies, such as the developer control plane (DCP) packages. These dependencies are specific to the platform that the AppHost is built on.

When the AppHost project runs, the orchestrator relies on these dependencies to provide the necessary functionality to the AppHost. For more information, see [Aspire orchestration overview](/docs/fundamentals/core-concepts/app-host).
