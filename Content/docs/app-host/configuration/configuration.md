The AppHost project configures and starts your distributed application. Configuration includes settings for the resource service, the [Aspire dashboard](/dashboard/overview), and internal settings used by integrations.

AppHost configuration is provided through launch profiles:


**C#**


In C# AppHosts, profiles live in `launchSettings.json`:

```json title="launchSettings.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json",
  "profiles": {
    "https": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "dotnetRunMessages": true,
      "launchBrowser": true,
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:17134;http://localhost:15170",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
        "DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
        "ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL": "https://localhost:21030",
        "ASPIRE_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL": "https://localhost:22057"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


**TypeScript**


In TypeScript AppHosts, profiles live in `aspire.config.json`:

```json title="aspire.config.json"
{
  "appHost": {
    "path": "apphost.ts",
    "language": "typescript/nodejs"
  },
  "profiles": {
    "https": {
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:17134;http://localhost:15170",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL": "https://localhost:21030",
        "ASPIRE_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL": "https://localhost:22057"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


> [!NOTE]
> Configuration described on this page is for the Aspire AppHost project. To

>   configuration](/dashboard/configuration).

## Common configuration

| Option                             | Default value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ASPIRE_ALLOW_UNSECURED_TRANSPORT` | `false`       | Allows communication with the AppHost without https. `ASPNETCORE_URLS` (dashboard address) and `ASPIRE_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL` (AppHost resource service address) must be secured with HTTPS unless true. |
| `ASPIRE_CONTAINER_RUNTIME`         | `docker`      | Allows the user of alternative container runtimes for resources backed by containers. Possible values are `docker` (default) or `podman`.                                                                        |
| `ASPIRE_VERSION_CHECK_DISABLED`    | `false`       | When set to `true`, Aspire doesn't check for newer versions on startup.                                                                                                                                          |

## Version update notifications

When an Aspire app starts, it checks if a newer version of Aspire is available on NuGet. If a new version is found, a notification appears in the dashboard with the latest version number, [a link to upgrade instructions](https://aka.ms/dotnet/aspire/update-latest), and button to ignore that version in the future.

![Screenshot of dashboard showing a version update notification with upgrade options.](/assets/whats-new/dashboard-update-notification.png)

The version check runs only when:

- The dashboard is enabled (interaction service is available).
- At least 2 days have passed since the last check.
- The check hasn't been disabled via the `ASPIRE_VERSION_CHECK_DISABLED` configuration setting.
- The app is not running in publish mode.

Updates are manual. You need to edit your project file to upgrade the Aspire SDK and package versions.

## Resource service

A resource service is hosted by the AppHost. The resource service is used by the dashboard to fetch information about resources which are being orchestrated by Aspire.

| Option                                    | Default value                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ASPIRE_RESOURCE_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_URL`    | `null`                                         | Configures the address of the resource service hosted by the AppHost. Automatically generated with _launchSettings.json_ to have a random port on localhost. For example, `https://localhost:17037`.                                                                                   |
| `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_RESOURCESERVICE_APIKEY` | Automatically generated 128-bit entropy token. | The API key used to authenticate requests made to the AppHost's resource service. The API key is required if the AppHost is in run mode, the dashboard isn't disabled, and the dashboard isn't configured to allow anonymous access with `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_UNSECURED_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS`. |

## Dashboard

By default, the dashboard is automatically started by the AppHost. The dashboard supports [its own set of configuration](/dashboard/configuration), and some settings can be configured from the AppHost.

| Option                                      | Default value                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ASPNETCORE_URLS`                           | `null`                                                      | Dashboard address. Must be `https` unless `ASPIRE_ALLOW_UNSECURED_TRANSPORT` or `DistributedApplicationOptions.AllowUnsecuredTransport` is true. Automatically generated with _launchSettings.json_ to have a random port on localhost. The value in launch settings is set on the `applicationUrls` property. |
| `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`                    | `Production`                                                | Configures the environment the dashboard runs as. For more information, see [Use multiple environments in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments).                                                                                                                    |
| `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_OTLP_ENDPOINT_URL`        | `http://localhost:18889` if no gRPC endpoint is configured. | Configures the dashboard OTLP gRPC address. Used by the dashboard to receive telemetry over OTLP. Set on resources as the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` env var. The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` env var is `grpc`. Automatically generated with _launchSettings.json_ to have a random port on localhost.   |
| `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT_URL`   | `null`                                                      | Configures the dashboard OTLP HTTP address. Used by the dashboard to receive telemetry over OTLP. If only `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT_URL` is configured then it is set on resources as the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` env var. The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` env var is `http/protobuf`.      |
| `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`     | `null`                                                      | Overrides the CORS allowed origins configured in the dashboard. This setting replaces the default behavior of calculating allowed origins based on resource endpoints.                                                                                                                                         |
| `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_UNSECURED_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS`| `false`                                                     | Configures the dashboard to not use authentication and accept anonymous access. Sets frontend, OTLP, MCP, and API auth modes to `Unsecured`.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_FRONTEND_BROWSERTOKEN`    | Automatically generated 128-bit entropy token.              | Configures the frontend browser token. This is the value that must be entered to access the dashboard when the auth mode is BrowserToken. If no browser token is specified then a new token is generated each time the AppHost is launched.                                                                    |
| `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT`         | `false`                                                     | Configures the dashboard to never send [usage telemetry](/dashboard/microsoft-collected-dashboard-telemetry).                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `ASPIRE_DASHBOARD_AI_DISABLED`              | `false`                                                     | [GitHub Copilot in the dashboard](/dashboard/copilot) is available when the AppHost is launched by a supported IDE. When set to `true` Copilot is disabled in the dashboard and no Copilot UI is visible.                                                                                                     |

The `DcpCliPath` property specifies the path to the **Developer Control Plane (DCP)** executable. The DCP is the core orchestration engine that Aspire uses to run and manage distributed application resources locally during development.

#### How it works

When you use the [Aspire SDK](/docs/app-host/project-structure/aspire-sdk), the build system automatically:

1. Imports the platform-specific `Aspire.Hosting.Orchestration` NuGet package (for example, `Aspire.Hosting.Orchestration.win-x64`).
2. Sets `DcpCliPath` to point to the `dcp` executable within that package.
3. Embeds this path as assembly metadata in your compiled AppHost.

At runtime, the AppHost reads this metadata to locate and start the DCP process, which then orchestrates your application's resources.

#### Override options

In rare cases, you may need to override the default DCP path:

| Method | Example |
| ------ | ------- |
| MSBuild property | `<DcpCliPath>C:\path\to\dcp.exe</DcpCliPath>` |
| Command-line argument | `--dcp-cli-path /path/to/dcp` |
| Configuration | `DcpPublisher:CliPath` |

#### When to use

You might override `DcpCliPath` in these scenarios:

- **Aspire contributors**: Testing with a custom or debug build of DCP when developing Aspire itself.
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Non-standard SDK layouts where automatic discovery doesn't work.
- **Troubleshooting**: Temporarily pointing to a specific DCP version to diagnose issues.

> [!TIP]
> If your AppHost fails to start with an error about missing DCP or orchestration dependencies, ensure you have the [Aspire SDK](/docs/app-host/project-structure/aspire-sdk) properly configured rather than manually setting `DcpCliPath`.
