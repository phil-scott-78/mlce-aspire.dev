Service discovery is how your services find each other. Instead of hardcoding URLs like `http://localhost:5001`, your frontend can simply reference the `catalog` service by name—and Aspire handles resolving the actual address.

## How service discovery works

When you connect services using `WithReference()`, Aspire sets up automatic service discovery:

1. **AppHost declares resources** and allocates endpoints
2. **Configuration is injected** into each service via environment variables
3. **Your code uses logical names** like `https+http://catalog`
4. **Aspire's resolver** translates names to actual addresses at runtime

**The key insight**: Your code uses logical service names (like `catalog`), and Aspire's configuration-based endpoint resolver translates those to actual addresses at runtime.

> [!TIP] Why this matters
> Service discovery eliminates "works on my machine" problems. The same code works locally (where `catalog` might be `localhost:5001`) and in production (where it might be `catalog.internal.cloudapp.net:443`)—without any code changes.

## Implicit service discovery by reference

Configuration for service discovery is only added for services that are referenced by a given project. For example, consider the following AppHost program:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var catalog = builder.AddProject<Projects.CatalogService>("catalog");
var basket = builder.AddProject<Projects.BasketService>("basket");

var frontend = builder.AddProject<Projects.MyFrontend>("frontend")
                      .WithReference(basket)
                      .WithReference(catalog);
```

In the preceding example, the _frontend_ project references the _catalog_ project and the _basket_ project. The two `WithReference` calls instruct Aspire to:

1. **Inject configuration** - Pass service discovery information for `catalog` and `basket` into `frontend`
2. **Enable resolution** - Allow `frontend` to use URIs like `https+http://catalog` in HttpClient

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't call `WithReference()`, the frontend won't have the configuration needed to discover that service. This is intentional—services only know about their explicit dependencies.

## Named endpoints

Some services expose multiple, named endpoints. Named endpoints can be resolved by specifying the endpoint name in the host portion of the HTTP request URI, following the format `scheme://_endpointName.serviceName`. For example, if a service named "basket" exposes an endpoint named "dashboard", then the URI `https+http://_dashboard.basket` can be used to specify this endpoint, for example:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<BasketServiceClient>(
    static client => client.BaseAddress = new("https+http://basket"));

builder.Services.AddHttpClient<BasketServiceDashboardClient>(
    static client => client.BaseAddress = new("https+http://_dashboard.basket"));
```

In the preceding example, two `HttpClient` classes are added, one for the core basket service and one for the basket service's dashboard.

### Named endpoints using configuration

With the configuration-based endpoint resolver, named endpoints can be specified in configuration by prefixing the endpoint value with `_endpointName.`, where `endpointName` is the endpoint name. For example, consider this _appsettings.json_ configuration which defined a default endpoint (with no name) and an endpoint named "dashboard":

```json
{
  "Services": {
    "basket": {
      "https": "https://10.2.3.4:8080" /* the https endpoint, requested via https://basket */,
      "dashboard": "https://10.2.3.4:9999" /* the "dashboard" endpoint, requested via https://_dashboard.basket */
    }
  }
}
```

In the preceding JSON:

- The default endpoint, when resolving `https://basket` is `10.2.3.4:8080`.
- The "dashboard" endpoint, resolved via `https://_dashboard.basket` is `10.2.3.4:9999`.

### Named endpoints in Aspire

Named endpoints can also be exposed by code in the App Host. For instance the previous example can be modeled as:

```csharp
var basket = builder.AddProject<Projects.BasketService>("basket")
    .WithHttpsEndpoint(port: 9999, name: "dashboard");
```

### Named endpoints in Kubernetes using DNS SRV

When deploying to Kubernetes, the DNS SRV service endpoint resolver can be used to resolve named endpoints. For example, the following resource definition will result in a DNS SRV record being created for an endpoint named "default" and an endpoint named "dashboard", both on the service named "basket".

```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: basket
spec:
  selector:
    name: basket-service
  clusterIP: None
  ports:
    - name: default
      port: 8080
    - name: dashboard
      port: 9999
```

To configure a service to resolve the "dashboard" endpoint on the "basket" service, add the DNS SRV service endpoint resolver to the host builder as follows:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddServiceDiscoveryCore();
builder.Services.AddDnsSrvServiceEndpointProvider();
```

For more information, see `AddServiceDiscoveryCore` and `AddDnsSrvServiceEndpointProvider`.

The special port name "default" is used to specify the default endpoint, resolved using the URI `https://basket`.

As in the previous example, add service discovery to an `HttpClient` for the basket service:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<BasketServiceClient>(
    static client => client.BaseAddress = new("https://basket"));
```

Similarly, the "dashboard" endpoint can be targeted as follows:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient<BasketServiceDashboardClient>(
    static client => client.BaseAddress = new("https://_dashboard.basket"));
```

## Troubleshooting

### Service not found or "No endpoints resolved"

**Symptoms**: HttpClient throws an exception like "No endpoints resolved for service 'myservice'" or connection is refused.

**Common causes**:
1. **Missing `WithReference()`** - The calling service wasn't connected to the target service in AppHost
2. **Wrong service name** - The name in your URI doesn't match the name in `AddProject()` or `AddContainer()`
3. **Service not started** - The target service failed to start or is still starting

**Solution**: Verify your AppHost connects the services:

```csharp
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api");
var frontend = builder.AddProject<Projects.Frontend>("frontend")
    .WithReference(api);  // ← This is required!
```

### Named endpoint doesn't resolve

**Symptoms**: Using `https://_endpointName.serviceName` returns an error.

**Solution**: Verify the endpoint is named in your AppHost:

```csharp
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 9999, name: "dashboard");  // ← Name must match
```

Then use the exact name with underscore prefix:

```csharp
client.BaseAddress = new("https://_dashboard.api");
```

### Understanding the URI format

The `https+http://` prefix means "prefer HTTPS, fall back to HTTP". Here's the breakdown:

| URI Format | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `https://catalog` | HTTPS only to default endpoint |
| `http://catalog` | HTTP only to default endpoint |
| `https+http://catalog` | Prefer HTTPS, fall back to HTTP |
| `https://_admin.catalog` | HTTPS to named "admin" endpoint |

> [!NOTE] The underscore prefix
> The `_` prefix before an endpoint name is not arbitrary—it's required syntax that tells the resolver you're specifying a named endpoint rather than a subdomain.
