## Prerequisites

- **.NET 10** or later — [Download .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
- **VS Code 1.98** or later.

## Install the extension


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
Open VS Code.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
Open the **Extensions** view ().

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
Search for **Aspire** and install the extension published by **Microsoft**.

</Step>
</Steps>

Or install directly from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://aka.ms/aspire/vscode).

## Getting started

Open your Aspire project in VS Code, or create one with **Aspire: New Aspire project** from the Command Palette. Run **Aspire: Configure launch.json file** to set up the debug configuration, then press . The extension builds your apphost, starts your services, attaches debuggers, and opens the dashboard.

There's also a built-in walkthrough at **Help > Get Started > Get started with Aspire** that covers the basics step by step.

## Running and debugging

### Launch configuration

Add an entry to `.vscode/launch.json` pointing at your apphost project:

```json title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
  "type": "aspire",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Aspire: Launch MyAppHost",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/MyAppHost/MyAppHost.csproj"
}
```

Or run **Aspire: Configure launch.json file** from the Command Palette to generate one automatically.

When you press , the extension builds the apphost, starts all resources (services, containers, databases) in the right order, attaches debuggers based on each service's language, and opens the dashboard.

You can also right-click an AppHost file in the Explorer and select **Run Aspire apphost** or **Debug Aspire apphost**.

### Deploy, publish, and pipeline steps

The `command` property in the launch config supports more than just running:

- **`deploy`** — Push to your defined deployment targets.
- **`publish`** — Generate deployment artifacts (manifests, Bicep files, etc.).
- **`do`** — Run a specific pipeline step. Set `step` to the step name.

```json title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
  "type": "aspire",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Aspire: Deploy MyAppHost",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/MyAppHost/MyAppHost.csproj",
  "command": "deploy"
}
```

### Customizing debugger settings per language

The `debuggers` property lets you pass debug configuration specific to a language. Use `project` for C#/.NET services, `python` for Python, and `apphost` for the apphost itself:

```json title=".vscode/launch.json"
{
  "type": "aspire",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Aspire: Launch MyAppHost",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/MyAppHost/MyAppHost.csproj",
  "debuggers": {
    "project": {
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "logging": { "moduleLoad": false }
    },
    "apphost": {
      "stopAtEntry": true
    }
  }
}
```

## The Aspire sidebar

The extension adds an **Aspire** panel to the Activity Bar with a live tree of your resources. In **Workspace** mode you see resources from the apphost in your current workspace, updating in real time. Switch to **Global** mode with the toggle in the panel header to see every running apphost on your machine.

Right-click a resource to start, stop, or restart it, view its logs, run resource-specific commands, or open the dashboard.

## Commands

All commands are available from the Command Palette () under **Aspire**.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **New Aspire project** | Create a new apphost or starter app from a template |
| **Initialize Aspire in an existing codebase** | Add Aspire to an existing project |
| **Add an integration** | Add a hosting integration (`Aspire.Hosting.*`) |
| **Update integrations** | Update hosting integrations and the Aspire SDK |
| **Publish deployment artifacts** | Generate deployment manifests |
| **Deploy app** | Deploy to your defined targets |
| **Execute pipeline step** | Run a pipeline step and its dependencies (`aspire do`) |
| **Configure launch.json file** | Add the Aspire debug config to your workspace |
| **Extension settings** | Open Aspire extension settings |
| **Open local Aspire settings** | Open `.aspire/settings.json` for this workspace |
| **Open global Aspire settings** | Open `~/.aspire/globalsettings.json` |
| **Open Aspire terminal** | Open a terminal with the Aspire CLI ready |
| **Install Aspire CLI (stable)** | Install the latest stable CLI |
| **Install Aspire CLI (daily)** | Install the daily preview build |
| **Update Aspire CLI** | Update the CLI |
| **Verify Aspire CLI installation** | Check that the CLI works |

## Language and debugger support

The extension detects each resource's language and attaches the right debugger. Some languages need a companion extension:

| Language | Debugger | Extension needed |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| C# / .NET | coreclr | [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) or [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) |
| Python | debugpy | [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) |
| Node.js | js-debug (built-in) | None |
| Browser apps | js-debug (built-in) | None |
| Azure Functions | Varies by language | [Azure Functions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) + language extension |

Node.js and browser debugging work out of the box — VS Code includes a built-in JavaScript debugger. C# Dev Kit gives you richer build integration than the standalone C# extension, but either works for debugging. Azure Functions debugging supports C#, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python.

## Extension settings

Configure the extension under **Settings > Aspire**, or jump there with **Aspire: Extension settings**.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `aspire.aspireCliExecutablePath` | `""` | Path to the Aspire CLI. Leave empty to use `aspire` from PATH. |
| `aspire.dashboardBrowser` | `openExternalBrowser` | Which browser opens the dashboard — system default, or Chrome/Edge/Firefox as a debug session. |
| `aspire.enableAspireDashboardAutoLaunch` | `true` | Open the dashboard automatically when you start debugging. |
| `aspire.registerMcpServerInWorkspace` | `false` | Register the Aspire MCP server (see [MCP Server Integration](#mcp-server-integration)). |

There are more settings for verbose logging, startup prompts, and polling intervals — run **Aspire: Extension settings** to see them all.

The extension also provides IntelliSense and validation when editing `.aspire/settings.json` (workspace-level) and `~/.aspire/globalsettings.json` (user-level). Use the **Open local/global Aspire settings** commands to open them.

## MCP server integration

The extension can register an Aspire [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server with VS Code. This lets AI tools — GitHub Copilot included — see your running app's resources, endpoints, and configuration for better context when helping you write code.

Turn it on by setting `aspire.registerMcpServerInWorkspace` to `true`. When enabled, the extension registers the MCP server definition via the Aspire CLI whenever a workspace is open and the CLI is available.
