[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) offers a cloud-hosted development environment based on Visual Studio Code. It can be accessed directly from a web browser or through Visual Studio Code locally, where Visual Studio Code acts as a client connecting to a cloud-hosted backend. Aspire works well in GitHub Codespaces and includes support for:

- Automatically configuring port forwarding with the correct protocol.
- Automatically translating URLs in the Aspire dashboard.

## GitHub Codespaces vs. Dev Containers

GitHub Codespaces builds upon Visual Studio Code and the [Dev Containers specification](https://containers.dev/implementors/spec/). While the experiences are similar, there are some differences. For more information, see [Aspire and Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](/docs/get-started/setup-and-tooling/dev-containers).

## Quick start using template repository

To configure GitHub Codespaces for Aspire, use the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file in your repository. The simplest way to get started is by creating a new repository from the [Aspire Dev Container template](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-devcontainer). Consider the following steps:


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
[Create a new repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=aspire-devcontainer&template_owner=dotnet) using our template.

Once you provide the details and select **Create repository**, the repository is created and shown in GitHub.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
From the new repository, select the **Code** button, open the **Codespaces** tab, and then select **Create codespace on main**.

After you select **Create codespace on main**, you navigate to a web-based version of Visual Studio Code. Before you use the Codespace, the containerized development environment needs to be prepared. This process happens automatically on the server and you can review progress by selecting the **Building codespace** link on the notification in the bottom right of the browser window.

When the container image has finished being built the **Terminal** prompt appears which signals that the environment is ready to be interacted with.

At this point, the Aspire CLI has been installed and the ASP.NET Core development certificate has been created and trusted inside the Codespace. You can use `aspire new` right away without manually installing `Aspire.ProjectTemplates`.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
Create a new Aspire project using the starter template.

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Create an Aspire starter app"
aspire new aspire-starter --name HelloAspire
```

This results in many files and folders being created in the repository, which are visible in the **Explorer** panel on the left side of the window.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="4">
Launch the AppHost via the `HelloAspire.AppHost/AppHost.cs` file, by selecting the **Run project** button near the top-right corner of the **Tab bar**.

![Screenshot showing how to launch the AppHost using the Run project button in VS Code.](/assets/get-started/codespace-launch-apphost.png)

After a few moments the **Debug Console** panel is displayed, and it includes a link to the Aspire dashboard exposed on a GitHub Codespaces endpoint with the authentication token.

![Screenshot of the Debug Console showing the Aspire dashboard URL with authentication token.](/assets/get-started/codespaces-debug-console.png)

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="5">
Open the Aspire dashboard by selecting the dashboard URL in the **Debug Console**. This opens the Aspire dashboard in a separate tab within your browser.

You notice on the dashboard that all HTTP/HTTPS endpoints defined on resources have had their typical `localhost` address translated to a unique fully qualified subdomain on the `app.github.dev` domain.

Traffic to each of these endpoints is automatically forwarded to the underlying process or container running within the Codespace. This includes development time tools such as PgAdmin and Redis Insight.

:::note
In addition to the authentication token embedded within the URL of the dashboard link of the **Debug Console**, endpoints also require authentication via your GitHub identity to avoid port forwarded endpoints being accessible to everyone. For more information on port forwarding in GitHub Codespaces, see [Forwarding ports in your codespace](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace?tool=webui).
:::

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="6">
Commit changes to the GitHub repository.

GitHub Codespaces doesn't automatically commit your changes to the branch you're working on in GitHub. You have to use the **Source Control** panel to stage and commit the changes and push them back to the repository.

Working in a GitHub Codespace is similar to working with Visual Studio Code on your own machine. You can checkout different branches and push changes just like you normally would. In addition, you can easily spin up multiple Codespaces simultaneously if you want to quickly work on another branch without disrupting your existing debug session. For more information, see [Developing in a codespace](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/developing-in-a-codespace?tool=webui).

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="7">
Clean up your Codespace.

GitHub Codespaces are temporary development environments and while you might use one for an extended period of time, they should be considered a disposable resource that you recreate as needed (with all of the customization/setup contained within the `devcontainer.json` and associated configuration files).

To delete your GitHub Codespace, visit the GitHub Codespaces page. This shows you a list of all of your Codespaces. From here you can perform management operations on each Codespace, including deleting them.

GitHub charges for the use of Codespaces. For more information, see [Managing the cost of GitHub Codespaces in your organization](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/choosing-who-owns-and-pays-for-codespaces-in-your-organization).

:::note
Aspire supports the use of Dev Containers in Visual Studio Code independent of GitHub Codespaces. For more information on how to use Dev Containers locally, see [Aspire and Dev Containers in Visual Studio Code](/docs/get-started/setup-and-tooling/dev-containers).

</Steps>

## Manually configuring devcontainer.json

The preceding walkthrough demonstrates the streamlined process of creating a GitHub Codespace using the Aspire Dev Container template. If you already have an existing repository and want to use Codespaces with Aspire, add a `devcontainer.json` file to the `.devcontainer` folder within your repository:

The [template repository](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-devcontainer) contains a copy of the `devcontainer.json` file that you can use as a starting point, which should be sufficient for Aspire.

The following `devcontainer.json` matches the current template repository and works well for most Aspire solutions in Codespaces:

```json title="JSON — .devcontainer/devcontainer.json"
{
  "name": "Aspire",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/dotnet:dev-10.0-noble",
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/docker-in-docker:2": {},
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/powershell:1": {},
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1": {},
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/python:1": {},
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers-extra/features/uv:1": {}
  },
  "hostRequirements": {
    "cpus": 8,
    "memory": "32gb",
    "storage": "64gb"
  },
  "onCreateCommand": "curl -sSL https://aspire.dev/install.sh | bash",
  "postStartCommand": "dotnet dev-certs https --trust",
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": [
        "ms-dotnettools.csdevkit",
        "GitHub.copilot-chat",
        "GitHub.copilot"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration installs the Aspire CLI during Codespace creation, so `aspire new` is ready to use as soon as the Codespace finishes building.

## Speed up Codespace creation

Creating a GitHub Codespace can take some time as it prepares the underlying container image. To expedite this process, you can utilize _prebuilds_ to significantly reduce the creation time to approximately 30-60 seconds (exact timing might vary). For more information on GitHub Codespaces prebuilds, see [GitHub Codespaces prebuilds](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/about-github-codespaces-prebuilds).
