The Aspire MCP server gives AI coding agents direct runtime access to your running Aspire application. Through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), agents can query resource status, read logs, inspect distributed traces, and execute commands — without you copy-pasting terminal output.

The MCP server is configured automatically when you run `aspire agent init` and select **Install Aspire MCP server**.

## Configuration

The `aspire agent init` command creates MCP server configuration files for your detected AI environment:


  **VS Code**

    Creates or updates `.vscode/mcp.json`:

    ```json title=".vscode/mcp.json"
    {
      "servers": {
        "aspire": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "aspire",
          "args": [
            "agent",
            "mcp"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  
  **Claude Code**

    Creates or updates `.mcp.json`:

    ```json title=".mcp.json"
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "aspire": {
          "command": "aspire",
          "args": [
            "agent",
            "mcp"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  
  **Copilot CLI**

    Creates or updates `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`:

    ```json title="~/.copilot/mcp-config.json"
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "aspire": {
          "type": "local",
          "command": "aspire",
          "args": [
            "agent",
            "mcp"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  
  **OpenCode**

    Creates or updates `opencode.jsonc`:

    ```jsonc title="opencode.jsonc"
    {
      "mcp": {
        "aspire": {
          "type": "local",
          "command": [
            "aspire",
            "agent",
            "mcp"
          ],
          "enabled": true
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  


## Tools

The Aspire MCP server provides the following tools to AI agents:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_resources` | Lists all resources, including state, health status, source, endpoints, and commands |
| `list_console_logs` | Lists console logs for a resource |
| `list_structured_logs` | Lists structured logs, optionally filtered by resource name |
| `list_traces` | Lists distributed traces, optionally filtered by resource name |
| `list_trace_structured_logs` | Lists structured logs for a specific trace |
| `execute_resource_command` | Executes a resource command (start, stop, restart) |
| `list_apphosts` | Lists detected AppHost connections and their scope |
| `select_apphost` | Selects which AppHost to use when multiple are running |
| `list_integrations` | Lists available Aspire hosting integration packages |
| `get_integration_docs` | Gets documentation for a specific integration package |
| `list_docs` | Lists all available documentation pages from aspire.dev |
| `search_docs` | Searches aspire.dev documentation using keyword-based search |
| `get_doc` | Retrieves the full content of a documentation page by slug |
| `doctor` | Diagnoses Aspire environment issues and verifies setup |
| `refresh_tools` | Requests the server to re-emit its tool list for clients to re-fetch |

### Exclude resources from MCP

By default, all resources, console logs, and telemetry are accessible through the MCP server. You can exclude specific resources and their associated telemetry by annotating them with `ExcludeFromMcp()`:


**C#**


```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var apiservice = builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_ApiService>("apiservice")
    .ExcludeFromMcp();

builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_Web>("webfrontend")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .WithReference(apiservice);

builder.Build().Run();
```


**TypeScript**


```typescript title="apphost.ts"

const builder = await createBuilder();

const apiservice = await builder
    .addProject("apiservice", "./api/ApiService.csproj")
    .excludeFromMcp();

await builder
    .addProject("webfrontend", "./web/Web.csproj")
    .withExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .withReference(apiservice);

await builder.build().run();
```


## Security

The Aspire MCP server is a development-time tool designed for local use.

### How it works

The MCP server uses the **STDIO transport protocol** when started via `aspire agent mcp`:

- The MCP server runs as a **local child process** spawned by your AI assistant.
- Communication happens over **standard input/output (STDIO) pipes**.
- There are **no open network ports** — the server doesn't listen on any network interface.
- Only the parent process (your AI assistant) can communicate with the MCP server.

> [!TIP]
> Because STDIO transport uses pipes rather than network sockets, there is no network attack surface. The MCP server is only accessible to the AI assistant process that started it.

### What data is accessible

The MCP server provides access to:

- **Resource metadata** — names, types, states, health status, endpoints, and commands
- **Console logs** — standard output and error streams
- **Structured logs** — log entries via OpenTelemetry
- **Distributed traces** — request flow across resources
- **Integration catalog** — available hosting integration packages
- **Product documentation** — Official LLMS.txt-based `aspire.dev` content 

The MCP server does **not** expose:

- Source code or file system contents
- Environment variable values or secrets
- Network traffic or raw request/response payloads
- Access to the host machine beyond the Aspire AppHost process

### Authentication

With STDIO transport (the default), no additional authentication is required — communication is restricted to the local process pipe.

For the HTTP-based MCP endpoint exposed by the Aspire dashboard (used in [manual MCP configuration](/dashboard/mcp-server) for older Aspire versions), an API key (`x-mcp-api-key` header) is required.

### Enterprise considerations

For teams evaluating the Aspire MCP server:

- **Development-time only** — not included in published or deployed applications
- **No external network access** — no network listeners when using STDIO transport
- **Data stays local** — telemetry remains on the developer's machine. Data shared with AI assistants is governed by the assistant's own data policies
- **Granular access control** — use `ExcludeFromMcp()` to restrict sensitive resources
- **No persistent storage** — all data is in memory for the session duration
- **Open specification** — implements the [Model Context Protocol specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)

## Deployment considerations

The MCP server is part of the Aspire CLI tooling and runs separately from your AppHost — it doesn't require explicit exclusion from deployments.

If your AppHost includes dev-only resources, use `ExecutionContext.IsRunMode` to exclude them from production:


**C#**


```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api");

if (builder.ExecutionContext.IsRunMode)
{
    // Only available during local development
    builder.AddContainer("dev-tool", "some-dev-image");
}

builder.Build().Run();
```


**TypeScript**


```typescript title="apphost.ts"

const builder = await createBuilder();

const api = await builder
    .addProject("api", "./api/Api.csproj");

if (await builder.executionContext.isRunMode()) {
    // Only available during local development
    await builder.addContainer("dev-tool", "some-dev-image");
}

await builder.build().run();
```


## Limitations

AI models have limits on how much data they can process. The Aspire MCP server may limit data returned from tools:

- Large data fields (e.g., long stack traces) may be truncated
- Large collections of telemetry may be shortened by omitting older items

## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, check the [open MCP issues on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aarea-mcp).

### AppHost detection

The MCP server automatically detects running AppHosts within the working directory scope:

- It continuously monitors for AppHost changes — no restart needed
- Use `list_apphosts` to see detected AppHosts
- Use `select_apphost` to switch between multiple running AppHosts

> [!NOTE]
> If your AI assistant doesn't detect your AppHost, verify it's running with `aspire start` and that the assistant was started from the same workspace directory.

### If your agent can't connect


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
Verify the Aspire CLI is installed:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire --version
```

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
Confirm your AppHost is running:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire start
```

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
Test the MCP server directly:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire agent mcp
```

If it starts without errors, the issue is in your AI assistant's configuration.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="4">
Regenerate configuration:

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire agent init
```

</Step>
</Steps>

### Claude Code issues

- Ensure `.mcp.json` exists in your project root — run `aspire agent init` to regenerate
- On Windows, commands like `npx` require a `cmd.exe /c` prefix
- Restart Claude Code to re-establish stale MCP connections
