Having issues getting started with Aspire? This page covers solutions to the most common problems developers encounter.

## Docker Desktop not running

**Symptoms**: `aspire run` hangs or shows "waiting for container runtime" messages.

**Solution**: Start Docker Desktop (or Podman) before running `aspire run`. Check your system tray to confirm Docker is running with a green status indicator.

> [!CAUTION]
> Aspire uses containers for databases, caches, and other resources. Without a
>   container runtime, these resources can't start.

## Port already in use

**Symptoms**: Error message like "Address already in use" or "Port 5000 is already bound."

**Solution**:

- Stop any other applications using the same ports
- If you have another Aspire app running, stop it first with ### How to find processes using a port

## Service shows "Unhealthy" in dashboard

**Symptoms**: A service has a red status or shows "Unhealthy" in the Aspire dashboard.

**Solution**:


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
Click on the service name in the dashboard to view its logs

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
Look for startup errors or exceptions

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
Verify the health check endpoint exists (e.g., `/health` returns a 200 OK)

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="4">
Check that all dependencies started successfully

</Step>
</Steps>

## "Connection refused" errors

**Symptoms**: Your frontend can't connect to the API, showing connection refused errors.

**Solution**: Make sure you're using `WaitFor()` in your AppHost:

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
builder.AddProject<Projects.WebFrontend>("frontend")
    .WithReference(apiService)
    .WaitFor(apiService);  // Add this line!
```

## Environment variables not available

**Symptoms**: Your service can't find connection strings or configuration that should be injected.

**Solution**: Verify you're using `WithReference()` to connect resources.

### Example: Connecting a database to your service

In your AppHost:

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
var db = builder.AddPostgres("db");
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithReference(db);  // This injects the connection string
```

In your service code, access the connection string via configuration:

```csharp title="Program.cs"
var connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("db");
```

The connection string is injected as an environment variable named `ConnectionStrings__db`.

## Container image pull failures

**Symptoms**: Error messages about failing to pull container images, or "image not found" errors.

**Solution**:

- Check your internet connection
- Verify Docker Hub or your container registry is accessible
- If using a corporate network, check proxy settings in Docker Desktop

### How to manually pull and verify an image

```bash
# Try pulling the image manually
docker pull redis:latest

# If behind a proxy, configure Docker Desktop:
# Settings > Resources > Proxies > Manual proxy configuration
```

## Dashboard not loading

**Symptoms**: The Aspire dashboard URL doesn't respond or shows a blank page.

**Solution**:


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
Check the console output for the correct dashboard URL (it may use a different port)

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
Ensure no browser extensions are blocking the page

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
Try a different browser or incognito mode

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="4">
Check if antivirus or firewall is blocking the connection

</Step>
</Steps>

## Service discovery not working

**Symptoms**: Services can't find each other by name (e.g., `http://apiservice` doesn't resolve).

**Solution**: Ensure you're using the service name exactly as defined in your AppHost.

### Example: Correct service discovery setup

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
// In AppHost
var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("apiservice");  // Name is "apiservice"
```

```csharp title="Program.cs"
// In your consuming service, use exactly this name
var client = new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri("http://apiservice") };
```

Also verify:

- Both services have `AddServiceDefaults()` called
- The consuming service has `.WithReference(api)` in the AppHost

## TypeScript AppHost issues

### "Command not found" errors

Ensure Node.js is installed and available in your `PATH`:

```bash title="Verify Node.js installation"
node --version
npm --version
```

### SDK compilation errors

If you encounter compilation errors in the generated `.modules/` SDK:

1. Ensure you have the latest version of the Aspire CLI installed.
2. Delete the `.modules` directory and run `aspire run` again to regenerate the SDK.
3. Check the [Aspire GitHub issues](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/issues) for known problems.

### Debug mode

Run with debug output to diagnose issues:

```bash title="Run with debug output"
aspire run --log-level Debug
```

### CLI logs

Aspire CLI logs are stored at:
