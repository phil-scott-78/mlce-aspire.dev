Each resource in the Aspire app model is represented as an `IResource` and when added to the distributed application builder, it's the generic-type parameter of the `IResourceBuilder<T>` interface. You use the _resource builder_ API to chain calls, configuring the underlying resource, and in some situations, you might want to add custom commands to the resource. Some common scenario for creating a custom command might be running database migrations or seeding/resetting a database. In this article, you learn how to add a custom command to a Redis resource that clears the cache.

## Add custom commands to a resource

Start by creating a new Aspire Starter App from the available templates. After creating this solution, add a new class named _RedisResourceBuilderExtensions.cs_ to the AppHost project. Replace the contents of the file with the following code:

```csharp title="RedisResourceBuilderExtensions.cs"
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using StackExchange.Redis;

namespace Aspire.Hosting;

internal static class RedisResourceBuilderExtensions
{
    public static IResourceBuilder<RedisResource> WithClearCommand(
        this IResourceBuilder<RedisResource> builder)
    {
        var commandOptions = new CommandOptions
        {
            UpdateState = OnUpdateResourceState,
            IconName = "AnimalRabbitOff",
            IconVariant = IconVariant.Filled
        };

        builder.WithCommand(
            name: "clear-cache",
            displayName: "Clear Cache",
            executeCommand: context => OnRunClearCacheCommandAsync(builder, context),
            commandOptions: commandOptions);

        return builder;
    }

    private static async Task<ExecuteCommandResult> OnRunClearCacheCommandAsync(
        IResourceBuilder<RedisResource> builder,
        ExecuteCommandContext context)
    {
        var connectionString = await builder.Resource.GetConnectionStringAsync() ??
            throw new InvalidOperationException(
                $"Unable to get the '{context.ResourceName}' connection string.");

        await using var connection = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(connectionString);
        var database = connection.GetDatabase();
        await database.ExecuteAsync("FLUSHALL");

        return CommandResults.Success();
    }

    private static ResourceCommandState OnUpdateResourceState(
        UpdateCommandStateContext context)
    {
        var logger = context.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();
        if (logger.IsEnabled(LogLevel.Information))
        {
            logger.LogInformation(
                "Updating resource state: {ResourceSnapshot}",
                context.ResourceSnapshot);
        }

        return context.ResourceSnapshot.HealthStatus is HealthStatus.Healthy
            ? ResourceCommandState.Enabled
            : ResourceCommandState.Disabled;
    }
}
```

The preceding code:

- Shares the `Aspire.Hosting` namespace so that it's visible to the AppHost project.
- Is a `static class` so that it can contain extension methods.
- It defines a single extension method named `WithClearCommand`, extending the `IResourceBuilder<RedisResource>` interface.
- The `WithClearCommand` method registers a command named `clear-cache` that clears the cache of the Redis resource.
- The `WithClearCommand` method returns the `IResourceBuilder<RedisResource>` instance to allow chaining.

The `WithCommand` API adds the appropriate annotations to the resource, which are consumed in the [Aspire dashboard](/dashboard/overview). The dashboard uses these annotations to render the command in the UI. Before getting too far into those details, let's ensure that you first understand the parameters of the `WithCommand` method:

- `name`: The name of the command to invoke.
- `displayName`: The name of the command to display in the dashboard.
- `executeCommand`: The `Func<ExecuteCommandContext, Task<ExecuteCommandResult>>` to run when the command is invoked, which is where the command logic is implemented.
- `updateState`: The `Func<UpdateCommandStateContext, ResourceCommandState>` callback is invoked to determine the "enabled" state of the command, which is used to enable or disable the command in the dashboard.
- `iconName`: The name of the icon to display in the dashboard. The icon is optional, but when you do provide it, it should be a valid [Fluent UI Blazor icon name](https://www.fluentui-blazor.net/Icon#explorer).
- `iconVariant`: The variant of the icon to display in the dashboard, valid options are `Regular` (default) or `Filled`.

## Execute command logic

The `executeCommand` delegate is where the command logic is implemented. This parameter is defined as a `Func<ExecuteCommandContext, Task<ExecuteCommandResult>>`. The `ExecuteCommandContext` provides the following properties:

- `ExecuteCommandContext.ServiceProvider`: The `IServiceProvider` instance that's used to resolve services.
- `ExecuteCommandContext.ResourceName`: The name of the resource instance that the command is being executed on.
- `ExecuteCommandContext.CancellationToken`: The `CancellationToken` that's used to cancel the command execution.

In the preceding example, the `executeCommand` delegate is implemented as an `async` method that clears the cache of the Redis resource. It delegates out to a private class-scoped function named `OnRunClearCacheCommandAsync` to perform the actual cache clearing. Consider the following code:

```csharp title="RedisResourceBuilderExtensions.cs"
private static async Task<ExecuteCommandResult> OnRunClearCacheCommandAsync(
    IResourceBuilder<RedisResource> builder,
    ExecuteCommandContext context)
{
    var connectionString = await builder.Resource.GetConnectionStringAsync() ??
        throw new InvalidOperationException(
            $"Unable to get the '{context.ResourceName}' connection string.");

    await using var connection = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(connectionString);

    var database = connection.GetDatabase();

    await database.ExecuteAsync("FLUSHALL");

    return CommandResults.Success();
}
```

The preceding code:

- Retrieves the connection string from the Redis resource.
- Connects to the Redis instance.
- Gets the database instance.
- Executes the `FLUSHALL` command to clear the cache.
- Returns a `CommandResults.Success()` instance to indicate that the command was successful.

## Update command state logic

The `updateState` delegate is where the command state is determined. This parameter is defined as a `Func<UpdateCommandStateContext, ResourceCommandState>`. The `UpdateCommandStateContext` provides the following properties:

- `UpdateCommandStateContext.ServiceProvider`: The `IServiceProvider` instance that's used to resolve services.
- `UpdateCommandStateContext.ResourceSnapshot`: The snapshot of the resource instance that the command is being executed on.

The immutable snapshot is an instance of `CustomResourceSnapshot`, which exposes all sorts of valuable details about the resource instance. Consider the following code:

```csharp title="RedisResourceBuilderExtensions.cs"
private static ResourceCommandState OnUpdateResourceState(
    UpdateCommandStateContext context)
{
    var logger = context.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();

    if (logger.IsEnabled(LogLevel.Information))
    {
        logger.LogInformation(
            "Updating resource state: {ResourceSnapshot}",
            context.ResourceSnapshot);
    }

    return context.ResourceSnapshot.HealthStatus is HealthStatus.Healthy
        ? ResourceCommandState.Enabled
        : ResourceCommandState.Disabled;
}
```

The preceding code:

- Retrieves the logger instance from the service provider.
- Logs the resource snapshot details.
- Returns `ResourceCommandState.Enabled` if the resource is healthy; otherwise, it returns `ResourceCommandState.Disabled`.

## Test the custom command

To test the custom command, update your AppHost project's _AppHost.cs_ file to include the following code:

```csharp title="AppHost.cs" {4}
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache")
                   .WithClearCommand();

var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_ApiService>("apiservice");

builder.AddProject<Projects.AspireApp_Web>("webfrontend")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .WithReference(cache)
    .WaitFor(cache)
    .WithReference(apiService)
    .WaitFor(apiService);

builder.Build().Run();
```

The preceding code calls the `WithClearCommand` extension method to add the custom command to the Redis resource. Run the app and navigate to the Aspire dashboard. You should see the custom command listed under the Redis resource. On the **Resources** page of the dashboard, select the ellipsis button under the **Actions** column:

![Aspire dashboard: Redis cache resource with custom command displayed.](/assets/fundamentals/custom-clear-cache-command.png)

The preceding image shows the **Clear cache** command that was added to the Redis resource. The icon displays as a rabbit crossed out to indicate that the speed of the dependent resource is being cleared.

Select the **Clear cache** command to clear the cache of the Redis resource. The command should execute successfully, and the cache should be cleared:

![Aspire dashboard: Redis cache resource with custom command executed.](/assets/fundamentals/custom-clear-cache-command-succeeded.png)

## Programmatically execute commands

In addition to executing commands through the [Aspire dashboard](/dashboard/overview), you can also execute commands programmatically using the `ResourceCommandService`. This service is useful when you need to:

- Execute commands from within your application code
- Automate command execution as part of a workflow
- Build custom tooling that needs to control resources

The most common scenario is to call commands from within other custom command implementations. The `ExecuteCommandContext` provides access to the `IServiceProvider`, which you can use to retrieve the `ResourceCommandService`.

### Execute commands from a custom command

The following example shows how to create a custom command that executes other commands. In this case, a "reset-all" command clears the cache and restarts a database:

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
using Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache")
    .WithClearCommand(); // Defines a "clear-cache" command as shown earlier

var database = builder.AddPostgres("postgres")
    .WithCommand("restart", "Restart Database", async (context, ct) =>
    {
        // Restart database implementation
        return CommandResults.Success();
    });

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithReference(cache)
    .WithReference(database)
    .WithCommand("reset-all", "Reset Everything", async (context, ct) =>
    {
        var logger = context.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();
        var commandService = context.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ResourceCommandService>();
        
        logger.LogInformation("Starting full system reset...");
        
        var clearResult = await commandService.ExecuteCommandAsync(
            resource: cache.Resource,
            commandName: "clear-cache",
            cancellationToken: ct);
            
        var restartResult = await commandService.ExecuteCommandAsync(
            resource: database.Resource,
            commandName: "restart",
            cancellationToken: ct);
        
        if (!clearResult.Success || !restartResult.Success)
        {
            return CommandResults.Failure("System reset failed");
        }
        
        logger.LogInformation("System reset completed successfully");
        return CommandResults.Success();
    });

builder.Build().Run();
```

In this example:

- The `context` parameter provides access to `ServiceProvider`
- The `ResourceCommandService` is retrieved from the service provider
- Commands are executed on resource instances using `cache.Resource` and `database.Resource`
- Each command result is checked for success before proceeding

### Execute a command by resource ID

You can also execute a command using the resource ID or resource name. The resource ID is the unique identifier for a resource instance, while the resource name is the display name (which must be unique to use this approach):

```csharp
var result = await commandService.ExecuteCommandAsync(
    resourceId: "cache", 
    commandName: "clear-cache",
    cancellationToken: cancellationToken);

if (result.Success)
{
    logger.LogInformation("Command executed successfully");
}
else if (result.Canceled)
{
    logger.LogWarning("Command was canceled");
}
else
{
    logger.LogError("Command failed: {ErrorMessage}", result.ErrorMessage);
}
```

The `resourceId` parameter can be either:
- The unique ID of the resource (e.g., `cache-abcdwxyz` for a resource with replicas)
- The display name (e.g., `cache`) if there are no duplicate names

### Execute commands on resources with replicas

When executing a command on a resource with multiple replicas using the `IResource` overload, the command runs in parallel on all instances:

```csharp
// For a resource with replicas, the command executes on all instances
var result = await commandService.ExecuteCommandAsync(
    resource: cache.Resource,
    commandName: "clear-cache",
    cancellationToken: cancellationToken);
```

The behavior when executing on multiple replicas:
- The command runs in parallel on all instances
- If all commands succeed, the result indicates success
- If any commands fail, the result includes details about the failures
- If all non-successful commands were canceled, the result indicates cancellation

### Handle command execution results

The `ExecuteCommandResult` class provides information about the command execution:

- **`Success`**: A boolean indicating whether the command was successful.
- **`ErrorMessage`**: An optional string property with an error message if the command was unsuccessful.
- **`Canceled`**: A boolean indicating whether the command was canceled by the user.

You can use these properties to handle different execution outcomes in your application logic. The `CommandResults` helper class provides factory methods to create result instances:

```csharp
// In your command implementation
return CommandResults.Success();
// or
return CommandResults.Failure("Error occurred during execution");
// or
return CommandResults.Canceled();
```
