The Aspire CLI collects usage telemetry to help Microsoft improve the product. This data helps the Aspire team understand how the CLI is used and identify areas for improvement.

## Scope

Aspire CLI telemetry is collected when using the CLI to run commands. Telemetry is gathered during normal CLI usage, unless you have [opted out](#how-to-opt-out) of telemetry collection.

## How to opt-out

To opt-out of telemetry collection, set the `ASPIRE_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` environment variable to `true`. This will disable telemetry collection for all CLI commands:

## Disclosure

The first time you run an Aspire CLI command, you'll see a disclosure message informing you that telemetry is being collected and how to opt out.

## Data points

Aspire CLI telemetry doesn't collect personal data, such as usernames or email addresses. It doesn't scan your code and doesn't extract source code, paths containing usernames, or environment-specific information. The data is sent securely to Microsoft.

Protecting your privacy is important to Microsoft. If you suspect that telemetry is collecting sensitive data or the data is being insecurely or inappropriately handled, file an issue in the [GitHub microsoft/aspire](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire) repository for investigation.
