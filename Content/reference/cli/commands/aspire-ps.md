## Name

`aspire ps` - List running Aspire AppHosts.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire ps [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire ps` command lists all running Aspire AppHost processes. The output includes the AppHost project path, process IDs, and dashboard URLs for each running instance.

The command scans for running AppHosts by checking the backchannel connections in the `~/.aspire/backchannels/` directory. This approach is fast because it doesn't need to recursively search for project files.

The default output is a human-readable table with the following columns:

| Column      | Description                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `PATH`      | The file path to the AppHost project               |
| `PID`       | The process ID of the running AppHost              |
| `CLI_PID`   | The process ID of the CLI that started the AppHost |
| `DASHBOARD` | The dashboard URL with login token                 |

In-scope AppHosts (those within the current directory) are displayed first, followed by out-of-scope AppHosts.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--format <Json|Table>`**

  Output result format. Use `Json` for machine-readable output suitable for scripting and automation. The JSON output includes an array of AppHost objects with `appHostPath`, `appHostPid`, `cliPid`, and `dashboardUrl` properties. Defaults to `Table`.

- List all running AppHosts in table format:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire ps
  ```

  Example output:

  ```text title="Output"
  PATH                                                PID    CLI_PID  DASHBOARD
  ./src/MyApp.AppHost/MyApp.AppHost.csproj            12345  12340    https://localhost:17244/login?t=abc123
  /home/user/other/OtherApp.AppHost.csproj            67890  67885    https://localhost:17250/login?t=def456
  ```

- Output running AppHosts as JSON for scripting:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire ps --format Json
  ```

  Example output:

  ```json title="Output"
  [
    {
      "appHostPath": "./src/MyApp.AppHost/MyApp.AppHost.csproj",
      "appHostPid": 12345,
      "cliPid": 12340,
      "dashboardUrl": "https://localhost:17244/login?t=abc123"
    }
  ]
  ```
