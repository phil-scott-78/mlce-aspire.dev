## Name

`aspire stop` - Stop a running Aspire AppHost.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire stop [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire stop` command stops a running Aspire AppHost process. When no options are provided, the command scans for running AppHosts and stops the in-scope AppHost directly, or prompts you to choose one when multiple AppHosts are available.

When executed without the `--apphost` option, the command:

1. Scans for all running AppHost processes.
2. If multiple AppHosts are running within the current directory scope, prompts you to select which one to stop.
3. If only one AppHost is running in scope, stops it directly.
4. If no in-scope AppHosts are found but out-of-scope AppHosts exist, displays all running AppHosts for selection.

The command sends a stop signal to the CLI process that started the AppHost, which ensures a clean shutdown of all resources including the dashboard and any containers or processes that were started.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--apphost <apphost>`**

  The path to the Aspire AppHost project file. When specified, the command stops only the AppHost running from that apphost without prompting for selection.

- **`--all`**

  Stop all running AppHosts without prompting for selection.

- - - - - - ## Examples

- Stop the AppHost running in the current directory scope:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire stop
  ```

- Stop a specific AppHost project:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire stop --apphost './src/MyApp.AppHost/MyApp.AppHost.csproj'
  ```

- Stop all running AppHosts:

  ```bash title="Aspire CLI"
  aspire stop --all
  ```
