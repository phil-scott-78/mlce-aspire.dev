## Name

`aspire doctor` - Check the Aspire development environment for common issues.

## Synopsis

```bash title="Aspire CLI"
aspire doctor [options]
```

## Description

The `aspire doctor` command runs a series of diagnostic checks to verify that your development environment is properly configured for Aspire development. It checks prerequisites such as the .NET SDK, container runtime, and environment settings.

> [!NOTE]
> The `aspire doctor` command replaces the hidden `aspire setup` command. If you
>   previously used `aspire setup` or `aspire setup --force`, use `aspire doctor`
>   instead. The `aspire setup` command is still available for backward
>   compatibility but is hidden from help output.

This command is useful for troubleshooting when you encounter issues with Aspire or when setting up a new development environment. The checks are grouped by category:

- **SDK checks**: Verifies .NET SDK installation and version requirements
- **Container checks**: Validates container runtime (Docker/Podman) availability and configuration
- **Environment checks**: Validates environment variables and other settings

The command displays results with clear status indicators:

- ✓ (green) - Check passed
- ⚠ (yellow) - Warning (non-blocking issue)
- ✗ (red) - Check failed (blocking issue)

If any checks fail, the command provides suggestions for how to fix the issues and links to relevant documentation.

## Options

The following options are available:

- **`--format <Table|Json>`**

  Output format (Table or Json). Use `Json` for automation scenarios or when you need to parse the results programmatically. Defaults to `Table`.
