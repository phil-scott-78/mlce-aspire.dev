To get started with the Aspire RavenDB integrations, follow the [Get started with RavenDB integrations](/integrations/databases/ravendb/ravendb-get-started) guide.

This article includes full details about the Aspire RavenDB Client integration.

## Installation

To get started with the Aspire RavenDB client integration, install the [📦 CommunityToolkit.Aspire.RavenDB.Client](https://nuget.org/packages/CommunityToolkit.Aspire.RavenDB.Client) NuGet package in the client-consuming project. The RavenDB client integration registers an `IDocumentStore` instance, which serves as the entry point for interacting with the RavenDB server. If your AppHost includes RavenDB database resources, the associated `IDocumentSession` and `IAsyncDocumentSession` instances are also registered for dependency injection.

<InstallPackage PackageName="CommunityToolkit.Aspire.RavenDB.Client" />

## Add RavenDB client

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddRavenDBClient` extension method to register an `IDocumentStore` for use via the dependency injection container. The method takes a connection name parameter.

```csharp
builder.AddRavenDBClient(connectionName: "ravendb");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the
>   RavenDB server resource (or the database resource, if provided) in the AppHost
>   project.

You can then retrieve the `IDocumentStore` instance using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(IDocumentStore client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

### Add RavenDB client using settings

The `AddRavenDBClient` method provides overloads that accept a `RavenDBClientSettings` object:

```csharp
var settings = new RavenDBClientSettings
{
    Urls = new[] { serverUrl },
    DatabaseName = myDatabaseName,
    Certificate = myCertificate
};

builder.AddRavenDBClient(settings: settings);
```

> [!NOTE]
> These methods are ideal for connecting to an existing RavenDB instance without
>   relying on the hosting integration.

## Add keyed RavenDB client

If your application requires multiple `IDocumentStore` instances with different connection configurations, you can register keyed RavenDB clients:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedRavenDBClient(serviceKey: "production", connectionName: "production");
builder.AddKeyedRavenDBClient(serviceKey: "testing", connectionName: "testing");
```

Then you can retrieve the `IDocumentStore` instances using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(
    [FromKeyedServices("production")] IDocumentStore production,
    [FromKeyedServices("testing")] IDocumentStore testing)
{
    // Use databases...
}
```

## Configuration

The Aspire RavenDB Client integration provides multiple configuration approaches and options to meet the requirements and conventions of your project.

### Use a connection string

When using a connection string from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section, provide the name of the connection string:

```csharp
builder.AddRavenDBClient("ravendb");
```

The connection string will be retrieved from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "ravendb": "Url=http://localhost:8080/;Database=ravendb"
  }
}
```

### Use configuration providers

The Aspire RavenDB integration supports configuration. It loads the `RavenDBClientSettings` from the configuration using the `Aspire:RavenDB:Client` key:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "RavenDB": {
      "Client": {
        "ConnectionString": "URL=http://localhost:8080;Database=ravendb",
        "DisableHealthChecks": false,
        "HealthCheckTimeout": 10000,
        "DisableTracing": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Use inline configurations

You can also pass an `Action<RavenDBClientSettings>` delegate to set up options inline:

```csharp
builder.AddRavenDBClient(connectionName: "ravendb", configureSettings:
    settings =>
    {
        settings.CreateDatabase = true;
        settings.Certificate = myCertificate;
        settings.DisableTracing = true;
    });
```

## Client integration health checks

The Aspire RavenDB client integration uses the configured client to perform a health check. If successful, the health check is considered healthy.
