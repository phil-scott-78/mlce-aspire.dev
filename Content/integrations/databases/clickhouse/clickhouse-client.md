To get started with the Aspire ClickHouse client integration, install the [📦 Aspire.ClickHouse.Driver](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.ClickHouse.Driver) NuGet package:

This article includes full details about the Aspire ClickHouse Client integration, which allows you to connect to and interact with ClickHouse databases from your Aspire consuming projects.

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.ClickHouse.Driver" />

The ClickHouse client integration registers two services you can use to interact with ClickHouse:

- **`IClickHouseClient`** — A simple, high-level API for querying and inserting data into ClickHouse.
- **`ClickHouseDataSource`** — An ADO.NET-compatible data source for scenarios that require connections or commands (e.g. for ORM usage).

For an introduction to the ClickHouse integration, see [Get started with the ClickHouse integrations](/integrations/databases/clickhouse/clickhouse-get-started).

## Add ClickHouse data source

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddClickHouseDataSource` extension method to register both `IClickHouseClient` and `ClickHouseDataSource` for use via the dependency injection container:

```csharp
builder.AddClickHouseDataSource(connectionName: "clickhousedb");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the
>   ClickHouse resource in the AppHost project.

You can then retrieve either service using dependency injection. Use `IClickHouseClient` for a simple query and insert API:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(IClickHouseClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

Or use `ClickHouseDataSource` when you need ADO.NET access (connections, commands, transactions):

```csharp
public class ExampleService(ClickHouseDataSource dataSource)
{
    // Use data source...
}
```

## Add keyed ClickHouse data source

There might be situations where you want to register multiple ClickHouse instances with different connection names. To register keyed ClickHouse data sources, call the `AddKeyedClickHouseDataSource` method:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedClickHouseDataSource(name: "analytics");
builder.AddKeyedClickHouseDataSource(name: "logging");
```

Then you can retrieve the instances using dependency injection. Both `IClickHouseClient` and `ClickHouseDataSource` are available as keyed services:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(
    [FromKeyedServices("analytics")] IClickHouseClient analyticsClient,
    [FromKeyedServices("logging")] IClickHouseClient loggingClient)
{
    // Use clients...
}
```

For more information on keyed services, see [.NET dependency injection: Keyed services](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#keyed-services).

## Properties of the ClickHouse resources

When you use the `WithReference` method to pass a ClickHouse server or database resource from the AppHost project to a consuming client project, several properties are available to use in the consuming project.

Aspire exposes each property as an environment variable named `[RESOURCE]_[PROPERTY]`. For instance, the `Host` property of a resource called `clickhousedb` becomes `CLICKHOUSEDB_HOST`.

### ClickHouse server

The ClickHouse server resource exposes the following connection properties:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Host` | The hostname or IP address of the ClickHouse server |
| `Port` | The port number the ClickHouse server is listening on (default: 8123) |
| `Username` | The username for authentication (default: `default`) |
| `Password` | The password for authentication |

### ClickHouse database

The ClickHouse database resource inherits all properties from its parent `ClickHouseServerResource` and adds:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `DatabaseName` | The ClickHouse database name |

> [!NOTE]
> Aspire exposes each property as an environment variable named `[RESOURCE]_[PROPERTY]`. For instance, the `Host` property of a resource called `clickhousedb` becomes `CLICKHOUSEDB_HOST`.

## Configuration

The ClickHouse integration provides multiple options to configure the server connection based on the requirements and conventions of your project.

### Use a connection string

When using a connection string from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section, you can provide the name of the connection string when calling `AddClickHouseDataSource`:

```csharp
builder.AddClickHouseDataSource("clickhousedb");
```

Then the connection string will be retrieved from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "clickhousedb": "Host=localhost;Port=8123;Username=default;Password=secret;Database=clickhousedb"
  }
}
```

### Use configuration providers

The ClickHouse integration supports `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`. It loads the `ClickHouseClientSettings` from configuration using the `Aspire:ClickHouse:Driver` key. Example `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "ClickHouse": {
      "Driver": {
        "ConnectionString": "Host=localhost;Port=8123;Username=default;Database=clickhousedb",
        "DisableHealthChecks": false,
        "DisableTracing": false,
        "DisableMetrics": true,
        "HealthCheckTimeout": "00:00:03"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The integration also supports named configuration sections for keyed services. When you call `AddKeyedClickHouseDataSource` with a name, the integration loads settings from `Aspire:ClickHouse:Driver:{name}` and merges them with the top-level settings. Named configuration takes precedence over the top-level configuration.

### Use inline delegates

You can pass the `Action<ClickHouseClientSettings>` delegate to set up options inline:

```csharp
builder.AddClickHouseDataSource(
    "clickhousedb",
    static settings => settings.DisableHealthChecks = true);
```

You can also configure the underlying connection string builder using the `Action<ClickHouseConnectionStringBuilder>` delegate:

```csharp
builder.AddClickHouseDataSource(
    "clickhousedb",
    configureConnectionString: static csb =>
    {
        csb.ConnectionString = "Host=localhost;Port=8123;Database=clickhousedb";
    });
```

### Configuration options

Here are the configurable options with corresponding default values:

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `ConnectionString` | The connection string of the ClickHouse database to connect to |
| `DisableHealthChecks` | A boolean value that indicates whether the database health check is disabled or not. Default: `false` |
| `DisableTracing` | A boolean value that indicates whether the OpenTelemetry tracing is disabled or not. Default: `false` |
| `DisableMetrics` | A boolean value that indicates whether the OpenTelemetry metrics are disabled or not. Default: `true` (the ClickHouse driver doesn't currently emit metrics) |
| `HealthCheckTimeout` | A `TimeSpan?` value that indicates the health check timeout. Default: `null` (uses system default) |

## Client integration health checks

By default, Aspire integrations enable [health checks](/docs/fundamentals/observability/health-checks) for all services. For more information, see [Aspire integrations overview](/integrations/overview).

The ClickHouse client integration handles the following:

- Adds a health check that calls `PingAsync` on the configured `ClickHouseDataSource`. If the ping succeeds, the health check is considered healthy.
- The health check name is `"ClickHouse"` for unkeyed services, or `"ClickHouse_{name}"` for keyed services.
- Integrates with the `/health` HTTP endpoint, which specifies all registered health checks must pass for app to be considered ready to accept traffic.

## Observability and telemetry

Aspire integrations automatically set up Logging, Tracing, and Metrics configurations, which are sometimes known as *the pillars of observability*. Depending on the backing service, some integrations may only support some of these features. Telemetry features can also be disabled using the techniques presented in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

### Logging

The Aspire ClickHouse client integration uses the following log categories:

- `ClickHouse.Driver`
- `ClickHouse.Driver.BulkCopy`
- `ClickHouse.Driver.Client`
- `ClickHouse.Driver.Command`
- `ClickHouse.Driver.Connection`
- `ClickHouse.Driver.Transport`

### Tracing

The Aspire ClickHouse client integration emits the following tracing activities using OpenTelemetry:

- `ClickHouse.Driver`

### Metrics

The Aspire ClickHouse client integration doesn't currently expose any OpenTelemetry metrics. The `DisableMetrics` setting defaults to `true`.
