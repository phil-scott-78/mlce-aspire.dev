[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) provides access to chat/completions, embeddings, image, and audio models via a REST API. The OpenAI integration lets you:

- Model an OpenAI account (endpoint + API key) once in the AppHost.
- Add one or more model resources that compose their connection strings from the parent.
- Reference those model resources from projects to get strongly-named connection strings.
- Consume those connection strings with the `Aspire.OpenAI` component to obtain an `OpenAIClient` and (optionally) an `IChatClient`.

In this introduction, you'll see how to install and use the Aspire OpenAI integrations in a simple configuration. If you already have this knowledge, see [OpenAI hosting integration](/integrations/ai/openai/openai-host) for full reference details.

> [!NOTE]
> To follow this guide, you must have created an Aspire solution to work with. To learn how to do that, see [Build your first Aspire app](/docs/get-started/first-app).

## Set up hosting integration

To begin, install the Aspire OpenAI hosting integration in your Aspire AppHost project:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Hosting.OpenAI" />

Next, in the AppHost project, create instances of OpenAI resources and pass them to the consuming client projects:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var openai = builder.AddOpenAI("openai");

var chat = openai.AddModel("chat", "gpt-4o-mini");
var embeddings = openai.AddModel("embeddings", "text-embedding-3-small");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(chat);

builder.Build().Run();
```

The preceding code adds an OpenAI parent resource and two model resources. Referencing `chat` passes a connection string named `chat` to the project. Multiple models can share the single API key and endpoint via the parent resource.

### Configure authentication

The integration creates a secret parameter named `openai-openai-apikey` that automatically falls back to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. Provide the key via the Aspire CLI:

```bash
aspire secret set Parameters:openai-openai-apikey sk-your-api-key
```

## Set up client integration

To get started with the Aspire OpenAI client integration, install the package:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.OpenAI" />

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, use `AddOpenAIClient` to register an `OpenAIClient` for dependency injection:

```csharp
builder.AddOpenAIClient(connectionName: "chat");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the OpenAI
>   resource in the AppHost project.

After adding the `OpenAIClient`, you can retrieve the client instance using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(OpenAIClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```
