This article includes full details about the Aspire Ollama Hosting integration.

## Installation

The Aspire Ollama hosting integration models an Ollama server as the `OllamaResource` type, and provides the ability to add models to the server using the `AddModel` extension method, which represents the model as an `OllamaModelResource` type. To access these types and APIs for expressing them as resources in your AppHost project, install the [📦 CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Ollama](https://nuget.org/packages/CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Ollama) NuGet package:

<InstallPackage PackageName="CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.Ollama" />

## Add Ollama resource

In the AppHost project, register and consume the Ollama integration using the `AddOllama` extension method to add the Ollama container to the application builder. You can then add models to the container, which download and run when the container starts, using the `AddModel` extension method:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var ollama = builder.AddOllama("ollama");

var phi35 = ollama.AddModel("phi3.5");

var exampleProject = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
                            .WithReference(phi35);

builder.Build().Run();
```

Alternatively, if you want to use a model from the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) model hub, you can use the `AddHuggingFaceModel` extension method:

```csharp
var llama = ollama.AddHuggingFaceModel("llama", "bartowski/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF:IQ4_XS");
```

When Aspire adds a container image to the AppHost, as shown in the preceding example with the `docker.io/ollama/ollama` image, it creates a new Ollama instance on your local machine.

## Download the LLM

When the Ollama container for this integration first spins up, it downloads the configured LLMs. The progress of this download displays in the **State** column for this integration on the Aspire dashboard.

> [!CAUTION]
> Keep the Aspire orchestration app open until the download is complete,
>   otherwise the download will be cancelled.

## Cache the LLM

One or more LLMs are downloaded into the container which Ollama is running from, and by default this container is ephemeral. If you need to persist one or more LLMs across container restarts, you need to mount a volume into the container using the `WithDataVolume` method:

```csharp
var ollama = builder.AddOllama("ollama")
                    .WithDataVolume();

var llama = ollama.AddModel("llama3");
```

## Use GPUs when available

One or more LLMs are downloaded into the container which Ollama is running from, and by default this container runs on CPU. If you need to run the container with GPU support, you can enable it using the `WithGPUSupport()` extension method.

**Nvidia:**

```csharp
var ollama = builder.AddOllama("ollama")
                    .WithGPUSupport();
ollama.AddModel("llama3");
```

**AMD:**

```csharp
var ollama = builder.AddOllama("ollama")
                    .WithGPUSupport(OllamaGpuVendor.AMD);
ollama.AddModel("llama3");
```

For more information, see [GPU support in Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/gpu/) and [GPU support in Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/19005).

## Hosting integration health checks

The Ollama hosting integration automatically adds a health check for the Ollama server and model resources. For the Ollama server, a health check is added to verify that the Ollama server is running and that a connection can be established to it. For the Ollama model resources, a health check is added to verify that the model is running and that the model is available, meaning the resource will be marked as unhealthy until the model has been downloaded.

## Open WebUI support

The Ollama integration also provides support for running [Open WebUI](https://openwebui.com/) and having it communicate with the Ollama container:

```csharp
var ollama = builder.AddOllama("ollama")
                    .WithOpenWebUI();
ollama.AddModel("llama3");
```
