description: Learn how to create a custom Aspire client integration for an existing containerized application.
order: 173
---



This article is a continuation of the [Create custom hosting integrations](/integrations/custom-integrations/hosting-integrations) article. It guides you through creating an Aspire client integration that uses [MailKit](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit) to send emails. This integration is then added into the Newsletter app you previously built. The previous example omitted the creation of a client integration and instead relied on the existing .NET `SmtpClient`. It's best to use MailKit's `SmtpClient` over the official .NET `SmtpClient` for sending emails, as it's more modern and supports more features/protocols. For more information, see [.NET SmtpClient: Remarks](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.mail.smtpclient#remarks).

## Prerequisites

If you're following along, you should have a Newsletter app from the steps in the [Create custom hosting integrations](/integrations/custom-integrations/hosting-integrations) article.

> [!TIP]
> This article is inspired by existing Aspire integrations, and based on the team's official guidance. There are places where said guidance varies, and it's important to understand the reasoning behind the differences. For more information, see [Aspire integration requirements](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/blob/f38b6cba86942ad1c45fc04fe7170f0fd4ba7c0b/src/Components/Aspire_Components_Progress.md#net-aspire-integration-requirements).

## Create library for integration

[Aspire integrations](/integrations/overview) are delivered as NuGet packages, but in this example, it's beyond the scope of this article to publish a NuGet package. Instead, you create a class library project that contains the integration and reference it as a project. Aspire integration packages are intended to wrap a client library, such as MailKit, and provide production-ready telemetry, health checks, configurability, and testability. Let's start by creating a new class library project.


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
Create a new class library project named `MailKit.Client` in the same directory as the `MailDevResource.sln` from the previous article.

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet new classlib -o MailKit.Client
```

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
Add the project to the solution.

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet sln ./MailDevResource.sln add MailKit.Client/MailKit.Client.csproj
```

</Step>
</Steps>

The next step is to add the following NuGet packages that the integration relies on. Add the following package references to your `MailKit.Client.csproj` file:

```diff lang="xml" title="XML — MailKit.Client.csproj"
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>
    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
    <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
  </PropertyGroup>

+  <ItemGroup>
+    <PackageReference Include="MailKit" Version="4.14.1" />
+    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder" Version="10.0.0" />
+    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Resilience" Version="10.0.0" />
+    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Abstractions" Version="10.0.0" />
+    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks" Version="10.0.0" />
+    <PackageReference Include="OpenTelemetry.Extensions.Hosting" Version="1.14.0" />
+  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

## Define integration settings

Whenever you're creating an Aspire integration, it's best to understand the client library that you're mapping to. With MailKit, you need to understand the configuration settings that are required to connect to a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server. But it's also important to understand if the library has support for _health checks_, _tracing_ and _metrics_. MailKit supports _tracing_ and _metrics_, through its [`Telemetry.SmtpClient` class](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/blob/master/MailKit/Telemetry.cs#L112-L189). When adding _health checks_, you should use any established or existing health checks where possible. Otherwise, you might consider implementing your own in the integration. Replace the `Class1.cs` file with the following code to the `MailKit.Client` project in rename it as `MailKitClientSettings.cs`:

```csharp title="C# — MailKitClientSettings.cs"
using System.Data.Common;

namespace MailKit.Client;

/// <summary>
/// Provides the client configuration settings for connecting MailKit to an SMTP server.
/// </summary>
public sealed class MailKitClientSettings
{
    internal const string DefaultConfigSectionName = "MailKit:Client";

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets the SMTP server <see cref="Uri"/>.
    /// </summary>
    /// <value>
    /// The default value is <see langword="null"/>.
    /// </value>
    public Uri? Endpoint { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets a boolean value that indicates whether the database health check is disabled or not.
    /// </summary>
    /// <value>
    /// The default value is <see langword="false"/>.
    /// </value>
    public bool DisableHealthChecks { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets a boolean value that indicates whether the OpenTelemetry tracing is disabled or not.
    /// </summary>
    /// <value>
    /// The default value is <see langword="false"/>.
    /// </value>
    public bool DisableTracing { get; set; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Gets or sets a boolean value that indicates whether the OpenTelemetry metrics are disabled or not.
    /// </summary>
    /// <value>
    /// The default value is <see langword="false"/>.
    /// </value>
    public bool DisableMetrics { get; set; }

    internal void ParseConnectionString(string? connectionString)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(connectionString))
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException($"""
                ConnectionString is missing.
                It should be provided in 'ConnectionStrings:<connectionName>'
                or '{DefaultConfigSectionName}:Endpoint' key.'
                configuration section.
                """);
        }

        if (Uri.TryCreate(connectionString, UriKind.Absolute, out var uri))
        {
            Endpoint = uri;
        }
        else
        {
            var builder = new DbConnectionStringBuilder
            {
                ConnectionString = connectionString
            };
            
            if (builder.TryGetValue("Endpoint", out var endpoint) is false)
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException($"""
                    The 'ConnectionStrings:<connectionName>' (or 'Endpoint' key in
                    '{DefaultConfigSectionName}') is missing.
                    """);
            }

            if (Uri.TryCreate(endpoint.ToString(), UriKind.Absolute, out uri) is false)
            {
                throw new InvalidOperationException($"""
                    The 'ConnectionStrings:<connectionName>' (or 'Endpoint' key in
                    '{DefaultConfigSectionName}') isn't a valid URI.
                    """);
            }

            Endpoint = uri;
        }
    }
}
```

The preceding code defines the `MailKitClientSettings` class with:

- `Endpoint` property that represents the connection string to the SMTP server.
- `DisableHealthChecks` property that determines whether health checks are enabled.
- `DisableTracing` property that determines whether tracing is enabled.
- `DisableMetrics` property that determines whether metrics are enabled.
- `Credentials` property for storing username and password credentials.

### Parse connection string logic

The settings class also contains a `ParseConnectionString` method that parses the connection string into a valid `Uri`. The configuration is expected to be provided in the following format:

- `ConnectionStrings:<connectionName>`: The connection string to the SMTP server.
- `MailKit:Client:ConnectionString`: The connection string to the SMTP server.

If neither of these values are provided, an exception is thrown.

## Expose client functionality

The goal of Aspire integrations is to expose the underlying client library to consumers through dependency injection. With MailKit and for this example, the `SmtpClient` class is what you want to expose. You're not wrapping any functionality, but rather mapping configuration settings to an `SmtpClient` class. It's common to expose both standard and keyed-service registrations for integrations. Standard registrations are used when there's only one instance of a service, and keyed-service registrations are used when there are multiple instances of a service. Sometimes, to achieve multiple registrations of the same type you use a factory pattern. Add the following code to the `MailKit.Client` project in a file named `MailKitClientFactory.cs`:

```csharp title="C# — MailKitClientFactory.cs"
using MailKit.Net.Smtp;

namespace MailKit.Client;

/// <summary>
/// A factory for creating <see cref="ISmtpClient"/> instances
/// given a <paramref name="smtpUri"/> (and optional <paramref name="credentials"/>).
/// </summary>
/// <param name="settings">
/// The <see cref="MailKitClientSettings"/> settings for the SMTP server
/// </param>
public sealed class MailKitClientFactory(MailKitClientSettings settings)
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Gets an <see cref="ISmtpClient"/> instance in the connected state
    /// (and that's been authenticated if configured).
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="cancellationToken">Used to abort client creation and connection.</param>
    /// <returns>A connected (and authenticated) <see cref="ISmtpClient"/> instance.</returns>
    /// <remarks>
    /// Since both the connection and authentication are considered expensive operations,
    /// the <see cref="ISmtpClient"/> returned is intended to be used for the duration of a request
    /// (registered as 'Scoped') and is automatically disposed of.
    /// </remarks>
    public async Task<ISmtpClient> GetSmtpClientAsync(
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        var client = new SmtpClient();
        try
        {
            if (settings.Endpoint is not null)
            {
                await client.ConnectAsync(settings.Endpoint, cancellationToken)
                    .ConfigureAwait(false);
            }

            return client;
        }
        catch
        {
            await client.DisconnectAsync(true, cancellationToken);
            client.Dispose();
            throw;
        }       
    }
}
```

The `MailKitClientFactory` class is a factory that creates an `ISmtpClient` instance based on the configuration settings. It's responsible for returning an `ISmtpClient` implementation that has an active connection to a configured SMTP server. Next, you need to expose the functionality for the consumers to register this factory with the dependency injection container. Add the following code to the `MailKit.Client` project in a file named `MailKitExtensions.cs`:

```csharp title="C# — MailKitExtensions.cs"
using MailKit;
using MailKit.Client;
using MailKit.Net.Smtp;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

namespace Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

/// <summary>
/// Provides extension methods for registering a <see cref="SmtpClient"/> as a
/// scoped-lifetime service in the services provided by the <see cref="IHostApplicationBuilder"/>.
/// </summary>
public static class MailKitExtensions

    /// <summary>

    public static void AddMailKitClient(
        this IHostApplicationBuilder builder,
        string connectionName,
        Action<MailKitClientSettings>? configureSettings = null) =>
        AddMailKitClient(
            builder,
            MailKitClientSettings.DefaultConfigSectionName,
            configureSettings,
            connectionName,
            serviceKey: null);

    /// <summary>

    public static void AddKeyedMailKitClient(

        string name,
        Action<MailKitClientSettings>? configureSettings = null)
    {
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(name);

        AddMailKitClient(
            builder,
            $"{MailKitClientSettings.DefaultConfigSectionName}:{name}",
            configureSettings,
            connectionName: name,
            serviceKey: name);
    }

    private static void AddMailKitClient(
        this IHostApplicationBuilder builder,
        string configurationSectionName,
        Action<MailKitClientSettings>? configureSettings,
        string connectionName,
        object? serviceKey)
    {
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(builder);

        var settings = new MailKitClientSettings();

        builder.Configuration
               .GetSection(configurationSectionName)
               .Bind(settings);

        if (builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString(connectionName) is string connectionString)
        {
            settings.ParseConnectionString(connectionString);
        }

        configureSettings?.Invoke(settings);

        if (serviceKey is null)
        {
            builder.Services.AddScoped(CreateMailKitClientFactory);
        }
        else
        {
            builder.Services.AddKeyedScoped(serviceKey, (sp, key) => CreateMailKitClientFactory(sp));
        }

        MailKitClientFactory CreateMailKitClientFactory(IServiceProvider _)
        {
            return new MailKitClientFactory(settings);
        }

        if (settings.DisableHealthChecks is false)
        {
            builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
                .AddCheck<MailKitHealthCheck>(
                    name: serviceKey is null ? "MailKit" : $"MailKit_{connectionName}",
                    failureStatus: default,
                    tags: []);
        }

        if (settings.DisableTracing is false)
        {
            builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
                .WithTracing(
                    traceBuilder => traceBuilder.AddSource(
                        Telemetry.SmtpClient.ActivitySourceName));
        }

        if (settings.DisableMetrics is false)
        {
            // Required by MailKit to enable metrics
            Telemetry.SmtpClient.Configure();

            builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
                .WithMetrics(
                    metricsBuilder => metricsBuilder.AddMeter(
                        Telemetry.SmtpClient.MeterName));
        }
    }
}
```

The preceding code adds two extension methods on the `IHostApplicationBuilder` type, one for the standard registration of MailKit and another for keyed-registration of MailKit.

> [!TIP]
> Extension methods for Aspire integrations should extend the `IHostApplicationBuilder` type and follow the `Add<MeaningfulName>` naming convention where the `<MeaningfulName>` is the type or functionality you're adding. For this article, the `AddMailKitClient` extension method is used to add the MailKit client. It's likely more in-line with the official guidance to use `AddMailKitSmtpClient` instead of `AddMailKitClient`, since this only registers the `SmtpClient` and not the entire MailKit library.

Both extensions ultimately rely on the private `AddMailKitClient` method to register the `MailKitClientFactory` with the dependency injection container as a [scoped service](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#scoped). The reason for registering the `MailKitClientFactory` as a scoped service is because the connection operations are considered expensive and should be reused within the same scope where possible. In other words, for a single request, the same `ISmtpClient` instance should be used. The factory holds on to the instance of the `SmtpClient` that it creates and disposes of it.

### Configuration binding

One of the first things that the private implementation of the `AddMailKitClient` methods does, is to bind the configuration settings to the `MailKitClientSettings` class. The settings class is instantiated and then binding is performed with the specific section of configuration. Then the optional `configureSettings` delegate is invoked with the current settings. This allows the consumer to further configure the settings, ensuring that manual code settings are honored over configuration settings. After that, depending on whether the `serviceKey` value was provided, the `MailKitClientFactory` should be registered with the dependency injection container as either a standard or keyed service.

> [!CAUTION]
> It's intentional that the `implementationFactory` overload is called when registering services. The `CreateMailKitClientFactory` method throws when the configuration is invalid. This ensures that creation of the `MailKitClientFactory` is deferred until it's needed and it prevents the app from erroring out before logging is available.

The registration of health checks, and telemetry are described in a bit more detail in the following sections.

### Add health checks

[Health checks](/docs/fundamentals/observability/health-checks) are a way to monitor the health of an integration. With MailKit, you can check if the connection to the SMTP server is healthy. Add the following code to the `MailKit.Client` project in a file named `MailKitHealthCheck.cs`:

```csharp title="C# — MailKitHealthCheck.cs"
using Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks;

namespace MailKit.Client;

internal sealed class MailKitHealthCheck(MailKitClientFactory factory) : IHealthCheck
{
    public async Task<HealthCheckResult> CheckHealthAsync(
        HealthCheckContext context,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        try
        {
            // The factory connects (and authenticates).
            _ = await factory.GetSmtpClientAsync(cancellationToken);

            return HealthCheckResult.Healthy();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            return HealthCheckResult.Unhealthy(exception: ex);
        }
    }
}
```

The preceding health check implementation:


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
Implements the `IHealthCheck` interface.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
Accepts the `MailKitClientFactory` as a primary constructor parameter.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
Satisfies the `CheckHealthAsync` method by:
- Attempting to get an `ISmtpClient` instance from the `factory`. If successful, it returns `HealthCheckResult.Healthy`.
- If an exception is thrown, it returns `HealthCheckResult.Unhealthy`.

</Step>
</Steps>

As previously shared in the registration of the `MailKitClientFactory`, the `MailKitHealthCheck` is conditionally registered with the `IHeathChecksBuilder`:

```csharp
if (settings.DisableHealthChecks is false)
{
    builder.Services.AddHealthChecks()
        .AddCheck<MailKitHealthCheck>(
            name: serviceKey is null ? "MailKit" : $"MailKit_{connectionName}",
            failureStatus: default,
            tags: []);
}
```

The consumer could choose to omit health checks by setting the `DisableHealthChecks` property to `true` in the configuration. A common pattern for integrations is to have optional features and Aspire integrations strongly encourages these types of configurations. For more information on health checks and a working sample that includes a user interface, see [Aspire ASP.NET Core HealthChecksUI sample](https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples/tree/main/samples/health-checks-ui).

### Wire up telemetry

As a best practice, the [MailKit client library exposes telemetry](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit/blob/master/Telemetry.md). Aspire can take advantage of this telemetry and display it in the [Aspire dashboard](/dashboard/overview). Depending on whether or not tracing and metrics are enabled, telemetry is wired up as shown in the following code snippet:

```csharp
if (settings.DisableTracing is false)
{
    builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
        .WithTracing(
            traceBuilder => traceBuilder.AddSource(
                SmtpClient.ActivitySourceName));
}

if (settings.DisableMetrics is false)
{
    // Required by MailKit to enable metrics
    SmtpClient.Configure();

    builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
        .WithMetrics(
            metricsBuilder => metricsBuilder.AddMeter(
                SmtpClient.MeterName));
}
```

## Update the Newsletter service

With the integration library created, you can now update the Newsletter service to use the MailKit client. The first step is to add a reference to the `MailKit.Client` project. Add the `MailKit.Client.csproj` project reference to the `MailDevResource.NewsletterService` project:

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet add ./MailDevResource.NewsletterService/MailDevResource.NewsletterService.csproj reference MailKit.Client/MailKit.Client.csproj
```

Next, add a reference to the `ServiceDefaults` project:

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet add ./MailDevResource.NewsletterService/MailDevResource.NewsletterService.csproj reference MailDevResource.ServiceDefaults/MailDevResource.ServiceDefaults.csproj
```

To make it easier to test the endpoints, add Scalar for a pleasant HTTP request user experience. Add the following NuGet package to the `MailDevResource.NewsletterService` project:

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet add package Scalar.AspNetCore --project ./MailDevResource.NewsletterService/MailDevResource.NewsletterService.csproj
```

The final step is to replace the existing `Program.cs` file in the `MailDevResource.NewsletterService` project with the following C# code:

```csharp title="C# — Program.cs"
using System.Net.Mail;
using MailKit.Client;
using MailKit.Net.Smtp;
using MimeKit;
using Scalar.AspNetCore;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddServiceDefaults();

builder.Services.AddOpenApi();

// Add services to the container.
builder.AddMailKitClient("maildev");

var app = builder.Build();

if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.MapOpenApi();
    app.MapScalarApiReference();
}

app.MapDefaultEndpoints();

// Configure the HTTP request pipeline.
app.UseHttpsRedirection();

app.MapPost("/subscribe",
    async (MailKitClientFactory factory, string email) =>
{
    ISmtpClient client = await factory.GetSmtpClientAsync();

    using var message = new MailMessage("newsletter@yourcompany.com", email)
    {
        Subject = "Welcome to our newsletter!",
        Body = "Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter!"
    };

    await client.SendAsync(MimeMessage.CreateFromMailMessage(message));
});

app.MapPost("/unsubscribe",
    async (MailKitClientFactory factory, string email) =>
{
    ISmtpClient client = await factory.GetSmtpClientAsync();

    using var message = new MailMessage("newsletter@yourcompany.com", email)
    {
        Subject = "You are unsubscribed from our newsletter!",
        Body = "Sorry to see you go. We hope you will come back soon!"
    };

    await client.SendAsync(MimeMessage.CreateFromMailMessage(message));
});

app.Run();
```

The most notable changes in the preceding code are:


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
The updated `using` statements that include the `MailKit.Client`, `MailKit.Net.Smtp`, `MimeKit`, and `Scalar.AspNetCore` namespaces.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
The replacement of the registration for the official .NET `SmtpClient` with the call to the `AddMailKitClient` extension method.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
The replacement of both `/subscribe` and `/unsubscribe` map post calls to instead inject the `MailKitClientFactory` and use the `ISmtpClient` instance to send the email.

</Step>
</Steps>

Back in the `AppHost.cs` file, update it to configure the scalar API reference endpoint:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var maildev = builder.AddMailDev("maildev");

builder.AddProject<Projects.MailDevResource_NewsletterService>("newsletterservice")
    .WithUrlForEndpoint("https", e =>
    {
        e.DisplayText = "Scalar";
        e.Url += "/scalar";
    })
    .WithReference(maildev);

builder.Build().Run();
```

## Run the sample

Now that you've created the MailKit client integration and updated the Newsletter service to use it, you can run the sample. From your IDE, select or run `aspire run` from the root directory of the solution to start the application—you should see the [Aspire dashboard](/dashboard/overview):

Once the application is running, navigate to the Scalar UI by seleting the added Scalar link from the dashboard on the `newsletterservice` resource and test the `/subscribe` and `/unsubscribe` endpoints. Select the down arrow to expand the endpoint:

Then select the `Try it out` button. Enter an email address, and then select the `Execute` button.

Repeat this several times, to add multiple email addresses. You should see the email sent to the MailDev inbox:

Stop the application by selecting in the terminal window where the application is running, or by selecting the stop button in your IDE.

### View MailKit telemetry

The MailKit client library exposes telemetry that can be viewed in the Aspire dashboard. To view the telemetry, navigate to the Aspire dashboard. Select the `newsletter` resource to view the telemetry on the **Metrics** page:

Open up the Scalar UI again, and make some requests to the `/subscribe` and `/unsubscribe` endpoints. Then, navigate back to the Aspire dashboard and select the `newsletter` resource. Select a metric under the **mailkit.net.smtp** node, such as `mailkit.net.smtp.client.operation.count`. You should see the telemetry for the MailKit client:

## Summary

In this article, you learned how to create an Aspire integration that uses MailKit to send emails. You also learned how to integrate this integration into the Newsletter app you previously built. You learned about the core principles of Aspire integrations, such as exposing the underlying client library to consumers through dependency injection, and how to add health checks and telemetry to the integration. You also learned how to update the Newsletter service to use the MailKit client.

Go forth and build your own Aspire integrations. If you believe that there's enough community value in the integration you're building, consider publishing it as a [NuGet package](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/library-guidance/nuget) for others to use. Furthermore, consider submitting a pull request to the [Aspire GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire) for consideration to be included in the official Aspire integrations.
