Aspire improves the development experience by providing reusable building blocks that can be used to quickly arrange application dependencies and expose them to your own code. One of the key building blocks of an Aspire-based application is the _resource_.

Consider the code below:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var redis = builder.AddRedis("cache");

var db = builder.AddPostgres("pgserver")
    .AddDatabase("inventorydb");

builder.AddProject<Projects.InventoryService>("inventoryservice")
    .WithReference(redis)
    .WithReference(db);
```

In the preceding code there are four resources represented:


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
`cache`: A Redis container.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
`pgserver`: A Postgres container.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
`inventorydb`: A database hosted on `pgserver`.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="4">
`inventoryservice`: An ASP.NET Core application.

</Step>
</Steps>

Most Aspire-related code that the average developer writes, centers around adding resources to the [app model](/docs/fundamentals/core-concepts/app-host) and creating references between them.

## Key elements of a custom resource

Building a custom resource in Aspire requires the following:


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
A custom resource type that implements `IResource`

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
An extension method for `IDistributedApplicationBuilder` named `Add{CustomResource}` where `{CustomResource}` is the name of the custom resource.

</Step>
</Steps>

When custom resource requires optional configuration, developers may wish to implement `With*` suffixed extension methods to make these configuration options discoverable using the _builder pattern_.

## A practical example: MailDev

To help understand how to develop custom resources, this article shows an example of how to build a custom resource for [MailDev](https://maildev.github.io/maildev/). MailDev is an open-source tool which provides a local mail server designed to allow developers to test e-mail sending behaviors within their app. For more information, see [the MailDev GitHub repository](https://github.com/maildev/maildev).

In this example you create a new Aspire project as a test environment for the MailDev resource that you create. While you can create custom resources in existing Aspire projects it's a good idea to consider whether the custom resource might be used across multiple Aspire-based solutions and should be developed as a reusable integration.

## Set up the starter project

Create a new Aspire project that is used to test out the new resource that we're developing.

```bash title="Aspire CLI — Create new Aspire project"
dotnet new aspire -o MailDevResource
```

<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
When prompted to select a template, choose the **AppHost and service defaults** template — use the and keys to navigate the options. Press to select the template.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
Enter a project name, in this example use `MailDevResource`, then press to continue.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
Finally, use the and keys to navigate to the desired template version. This example uses 13.1.0.

</Step>
</Steps>

```bash title="Change directory"
cd MailDevResource
```

Once the project is created, you should see a listing containing the following:

- `MailDevResource.AppHost`: The [AppHost](/docs/fundamentals/core-concepts/app-host) used to test out the custom resource.
- `MailDevResource.ServiceDefaults`: The [service defaults](/docs/app-host/project-structure/csharp-service-defaults) project for use in service-related projects.
- `MailDevResource.sln`: The solution file referencing both projects.

Verify that the project can build and run successfully by executing the following command:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — run"
aspire run
```

The console output should look similar to the following:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — run example output"
🔍  Finding apphosts...
MailDevResource.AppHost\MailDevResource.AppHost.csproj

🗄  Created settings file at '.aspire/settings.json'.

     AppHost:  MailDevResource.AppHost\MailDevResource.AppHost.csproj

   Dashboard:  https://localhost:17099/login?t=11e860924357145f02153fe9eb81f1ab

        Logs:  %USERPROFILE%\.aspire\cli\logs\apphost-24232-2025-12-03-16-34-36.log

               Press CTRL+C to stop the apphost and exit.  
```

Select the dashboard link in the browser to see the Aspire dashboard:

Press to shut down the app (you can close the browser tab).

## Create library for resource extension

Aspire resources are just classes and methods contained within a class library that references the Aspire Hosting library (`Aspire.Hosting`). By placing the resource in a separate project, you can more easily share it between Aspire-based apps and potentially package and share it on NuGet.


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
Create the class library project named `MailDev.Hosting`.

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet new classlib -o MailDev.Hosting
```

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
Add `Aspire.Hosting` to the class library as a package reference.

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet add ./MailDev.Hosting/MailDev.Hosting.csproj package Aspire.Hosting --version 13.1.0
```

:::note
The version you specify here should match the Aspire SDK version used in your solution.
:::

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
Add class library reference to the `MailDevResource.AppHost` project.

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet add ./MailDevResource.AppHost/MailDevResource.AppHost.csproj reference ./MailDev.Hosting/MailDev.Hosting.csproj
```

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="4">
Add class library project to the solution file.

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet sln ./MailDevResource.sln add ./MailDev.Hosting/MailDev.Hosting.csproj
```

</Step>
</Steps>

Once the following steps are performed, update the project reference in the `MailDevResource.AppHost.csproj` file to include an additional attribute to suppress a warning that appears when launching the AppHost. To tell Aspire that the project reference should be treated as a nonservice project modify the `MailDevResource.AppHost.csproj` file's reference to the `MailDev.Hosting` project to be the following:

```xml title="XML — MailDevResource.AppHost.csproj" 'IsAspireProjectResource="false"'
<ItemGroup>
  <!-- The IsAspireProjectResource attribute tells Aspire to treat this
       reference as a standard project reference and not attempt to generate
       a metadata file -->
  <ProjectReference Include="..\MailDev.Hosting\MailDev.Hosting.csproj"
                    IsAspireProjectResource="false" />
</ItemGroup>
```

This is because Aspire treats project references in the AppHost as if they're service projects.

## Define the resource types

The `MailDev.Hosting` class library contains the resource type and extension methods for adding the resource to the AppHost. You should first think about the experience that you want to give developers when using your custom resource. In the case of this custom resource, you would want developers to be able to write code like the following:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var maildev = builder.AddMailDev("maildev");

builder.AddProject<Projects.NewsletterService>("newsletterservice")
    .WithReference(maildev);
```

To achieve this, you need a custom resource named `MailDevResource` which implements `IResourceWithConnectionString` so that consumers can use it with the `WithReference` extension to inject the connection details for the MailDev server as a connection string.

MailDev is available as a container resource, so you'll also want to derive from `ContainerResource` so that we can make use of various pre-existing container-focused extensions in Aspire.

Replace the contents of the `Class1.cs` file in the `MailDev.Hosting` project, and rename the file to `MailDevResource.cs` with the following code:

```csharp title="C# — MailDevResource.cs"
// For ease of discovery, resource types should be placed in
// the Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel namespace. If there is
// likelihood of a conflict on the resource name consider using
// an alternative namespace.
namespace Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel;

public sealed class MailDevResource([ResourceName] string name) 
    : ContainerResource(name), IResourceWithConnectionString
{
    // Constants used to refer to well known-endpoint names, this is specific
    // for each resource type. MailDev exposes an SMTP endpoint and a HTTP
    // endpoint.
    internal const string SmtpEndpointName = "smtp";
    internal const string HttpEndpointName = "http";

    // An EndpointReference is a core Aspire type used for keeping
    // track of endpoint details in expressions. Simple literal values cannot
    // be used because endpoints are not known until containers are launched.
    private EndpointReference? _smtpReference;

    public EndpointReference SmtpEndpoint =>
        _smtpReference ??= new(this, SmtpEndpointName);

    // Required property on IResourceWithConnectionString. Represents a connection
    // string that applications can use to access the MailDev server. In this case
    // the connection string is composed of the SmtpEndpoint endpoint reference.
    public ReferenceExpression ConnectionStringExpression =>
        ReferenceExpression.Create(
            $"smtp://{SmtpEndpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.HostAndPort)}"
        );
}
```

In the preceding custom resource, the `EndpointReference` and `ReferenceExpression` are examples of several types which implement a collection of interfaces, such as `IManifestExpressionProvider`, `IValueProvider`, and `IValueWithReferences`. For more information about these types and their role in Aspire, see the [technical details section](#technical-details).

## Define the resource extensions

To make it easy for developers to use the custom resource an extension method named `AddMailDev` needs to be added to the `MailDev.Hosting` project. The `AddMailDev` extension method is responsible for configuring the resource so it can start successfully as a container.

Add the following code to a new file named `MailDevResourceBuilderExtensions.cs` in the `MailDev.Hosting` project:

```csharp title="C# — MailDevResourceBuilderExtensions.cs"
using Aspire.Hosting.ApplicationModel;

// Put extensions in the Aspire.Hosting namespace to ease discovery as referencing
// the Aspire hosting package automatically adds this namespace.
namespace Aspire.Hosting;

public static class MailDevResourceBuilderExtensions
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Adds the <see cref="MailDevResource"/> to the given
    /// <paramref name="builder"/> instance. Uses the "2.2.1" tag.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="builder">The <see cref="IDistributedApplicationBuilder"/>.</param>
    /// <param name="name">The name of the resource.</param>
    /// <param name="httpPort">The HTTP port.</param>
    /// <param name="smtpPort">The SMTP port.</param>
    /// <returns>
    /// An <see cref="IResourceBuilder{MailDevResource}"/> instance that
    /// represents the added MailDev resource.
    /// </returns>
    public static IResourceBuilder<MailDevResource> AddMailDev(
        this IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder,
        [ResourceName] string name,
        int? httpPort = null,
        int? smtpPort = null)
    {
        // The AddResource method is a core API within Aspire and is
        // used by resource developers to wrap a custom resource in an
        // IResourceBuilder<T> instance. Extension methods to customize
        // the resource (if any exist) target the builder interface.
        var resource = new MailDevResource(name);

        return builder.AddResource(resource)
                      .WithImage(MailDevContainerImageTags.Image)
                      .WithImageRegistry(MailDevContainerImageTags.Registry)
                      .WithImageTag(MailDevContainerImageTags.Tag)
                      .WithHttpEndpoint(
                          targetPort: 1080,
                          port: httpPort,
                          name: MailDevResource.HttpEndpointName)
                      .WithEndpoint(
                          targetPort: 1025,
                          port: smtpPort,
                          name: MailDevResource.SmtpEndpointName);
    }
}

// This class just contains constant strings that can be updated periodically
// when new versions of the underlying container are released.
internal static class MailDevContainerImageTags
{
    internal const string Registry = "docker.io";

    internal const string Image = "maildev/maildev";

    internal const string Tag = "2.2.1";
}
```

> [!TIP]
> This example uses MailDev version 2.2.1. Be sure to check the [MailDev Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/maildev/maildev/tags) for the latest version and update the `Tag` constant accordingly.

## Validate custom integration inside the AppHost

Now that the basic structure for the custom resource is complete it's time to test it in a real AppHost project. Open the `AppHost.cs` file in the `MailDevResource.AppHost` project and update it with the following code:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var maildev = builder.AddMailDev("maildev");

builder.Build().Run();
```

After updating the `AppHost.cs` file, launch the AppHost project and open the dashboard:

```bash title="Aspire CLI — run"
aspire run
```

After a few moments the dashboard shows that the `maildev` resource is running and a hyperlink will be available that navigates to the MailDev web app, which shows the content of each e-mail that your app sends.

_The Aspire dashboard should look similar to the following:_

_The MailDev web app should look similar to the following:_

## Add a .NET service project to the AppHost for testing

Once Aspire can successfully launch the MailDev integration, it's time to consume the connection information for MailDev within a .NET project. In Aspire it's common for there to be a _hosting package_ and one or more _component packages_. For example consider:

- **Hosting package**: Used to represent resources within the app model.
  - `Aspire.Hosting.Redis`
- **Component packages**: Used to configure and consume client libraries.
  - `Aspire.StackExchange.Redis`
  - `Aspire.StackExchange.Redis.DistributedCaching`
  - `Aspire.StackExchange.Redis.OutputCaching`

In the case of the MailDev resource, the .NET platform already has a simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) client in the form of `SmtpClient`. In this example you use this existing API for the sake of simplicity, although other resource types may benefit from custom integration libraries to assist developers.

In order to test the end-to-end scenario, you need a .NET project which we can inject the connection information into for the MailDev resource. Add a Web API project:


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
Create a new .NET project named `MailDevResource.NewsletterService`.

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet new webapi --use-minimal-apis -o MailDevResource.NewsletterService
```

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
Add a reference to the `MailDev.Hosting` project.

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet add ./MailDevResource.NewsletterService/MailDevResource.NewsletterService.csproj reference ./MailDev.Hosting/MailDev.Hosting.csproj
```

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
Add a reference to the `MailDevResource.AppHost` project.

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet add ./MailDevResource.AppHost/MailDevResource.AppHost.csproj reference ./MailDevResource.NewsletterService/MailDevResource.NewsletterService.csproj
```

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="4">
Add the new project to the solution file.

```bash title=".NET CLI"
dotnet sln ./MailDevResource.sln add ./MailDevResource.NewsletterService/MailDevResource.NewsletterService.csproj
```

</Step>
</Steps>

After the project has been added and references have been updated, open the `AppHost.cs` of the `MailDevResource.AppHost.csproj` project, and update the source file to look like the following:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var maildev = builder.AddMailDev("maildev");

builder.AddProject<Projects.MailDevResource_NewsletterService>("newsletterservice")
    .WithReference(maildev);

builder.Build().Run();
```

After updating the `AppHost.cs` file, launch the AppHost again. Then verify that the Newsletter Service started and that the environment variable `ConnectionStrings__maildev` was added to the process. From the **Resources** page, find the `newsletterservice` row, and select the **...** button on the **Actions** column, then select **View details**. In the **Environment Variables** section, you should see the following:

The preceding screenshot shows the environment variables for the `newsletterservice` project. The `ConnectionStrings__maildev` environment variable is the connection string that was injected into the project by the `maildev` resource.

## Use connection string to send messages

To use the SMTP connection details that were injected into the newsletter service project, you inject an instance of `SmtpClient` into the dependency injection container as a singleton. Add the following code to the `Program.cs` file in the `MailDevResource.NewsletterService` project to set up the singleton service. In the `Program` class, immediately following the `// Add services to the container` comment, add the following code:

```csharp title="C# — Program.cs"
builder.Services.AddSingleton<SmtpClient>(serviceProvider =>
{
    var connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("maildev");
    var uri = new Uri(connectionString ?? "smtp://localhost:1025");

    return new SmtpClient(uri.Host, uri.Port);
});
```

> [!CAUTION]
> This code snippet relies on the official `SmtpClient`, however; this type is obsolete on some platforms and not recommended on others. For a more modern approach using [MailKit](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit), see [Create custom Aspire client integrations](/integrations/custom-integrations/client-integrations).

To test the client, add two simple `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` POST methods to the newsletter service. Add the following code replacing the "weatherforecast" `MapGet` call in the `Program.cs` file of the `MailDevResource.NewsletterService` project to set up the ASP.NET Core routes:

```csharp title="C# — Program.cs"
app.MapPost("/subscribe", async (string email, SmtpClient client) =>
{
    var message = new MailMessage("noreply@newsletter.local", email)
    {
        Subject = "Welcome to the newsletter!",
        Body = "Welcome! You've subscribed to the newsletter."
    };

    await client.SendMailAsync(message);

    return Results.Ok("Subscribed");
});

app.MapPost("/unsubscribe", async (string email, SmtpClient client) =>
{
    var message = new MailMessage("noreply@newsletter.local", email)
    {
        Subject = "Goodbye from the newsletter",
        Body = "You have been unsubscribed from the newsletter."
    };

    await client.SendMailAsync(message);

    return Results.Ok("Unsubscribed");
});
```

> [!TIP]
> Remember to reference the `System.Net.Mail` namespaces in `Program.cs` if your code editor doesn't automatically add them.

Once the `Program.cs` file is updated, launch the AppHost and use your browser, or `curl` to hit the following URLs (alternatively if you're using Visual Studio you can use `.http` files). The important thing to note, is that you obtain the correct port number from the Aspire dashboard for the `newsletterservice` resource, for example:

```http title="HTTP request — subscribe"
POST /subscribe?email=test@test.com HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:7286
Content-Type: application/json
```

> [!NOTE]
> Your port number will likely be different to `7286` shown in this example. Be sure to replace it with the correct port number from your Aspire dashboard.

To use this API, you can use `curl` to send the request. The following `curl` command sends an HTTP `POST` request to the `subscribe` endpoint, and it expects an `email` query string value to subscribe to the newsletter. The `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json` to indicate that the request body is in JSON format.


    **Bash**

        ```bash
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            --request POST \
            https://localhost:7286/subscribe?email=test@test.com
        ```
    

    **PowerShell**

        ```powershell
        curl -H @{ ContentType = "application/json" } `
            -Method POST `
            https://localhost:7286/subscribe?email=test@test.com
        ```
    


The next API is the `unsubscribe` endpoint. This endpoint is used to unsubscribe from the newsletter.

```http title="HTTP request — unsubscribe"
POST /unsubscribe?email=test@test.com HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:7286
Content-Type: application/json
```

To unsubscribe from the newsletter, you can use the following `curl` command, passing an `email` parameter to the `unsubscribe` endpoint as a query string:


    **Bash**

        ```bash
        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            --request POST \
            https://localhost:7286/unsubscribe?email=test@test.com
        ```
    

    **PowerShell**

        ```powershell
        curl -H @{ ContentType = "application/json" } `
            -Method POST `
            https://localhost:7286/unsubscribe?email=test@test.com
        ```
    


If those API calls return a successful response (HTTP 200, Ok) then you should be able to select on the `maildev` resource the dashboard and the MailDev UI will show the emails that have been sent to the SMTP endpoint.

## Technical details

In the following sections, various technical details are discussed which are important to understand when developing custom resources for Aspire.

### Secure networking

In this example, the MailDev resource is a container resource which is exposed to the host machine over HTTP and SMTP. The MailDev resource is a development tool and isn't intended for production use. To instead use HTTPS, see [MailDev: Configure HTTPS](https://github.com/maildev/maildev/blob/1f2c75be259eaf3c2bf9e04f8193f5924cb324ff/docs/https.md).

When developing custom resources that expose network endpoints, it's important to consider the security implications of the resource. For example, if the resource is a database, it's important to ensure that the database is secure and that the connection string isn't exposed to the public internet.

### The `ReferenceExpression` and `EndpointReference` type

In the preceding code, the `MailDevResource` had two properties:

- `SmtpEndpoint`: An `EndpointReference` type.
- `ConnectionStringExpression`: A `ReferenceExpression` type.

These types are among several which are used throughout Aspire to represent configuration data, which isn't finalized until the Aspire project is either run or published to the cloud via a tool such as [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview).

The fundamental problem that these types help to solve, is deferring resolution of concrete configuration information until _all_ the information is available.

For example, the `MailDevResource` exposes a property called `ConnectionStringExpression` as required by the `IResourceWithConnectionString` interface. The type of the property is `ReferenceExpression` and is created by passing in an interpolated string to the `ReferenceExpression.Create` method.

```csharp
public ReferenceExpression ConnectionStringExpression =>
    ReferenceExpression.Create(
        $"smtp://{SmtpEndpoint.Property(EndpointProperty.HostAndPort)}"
    );
```

The signature for the `ReferenceExpression.Create` method is as follows:

```csharp
public static ReferenceExpression Create(
    in ExpressionInterpolatedStringHandler handler)
```

This isn't a regular string argument. The method makes use of the [interpolated string handler pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com//csharp/whats-new/tutorials/interpolated-string-handler), to capture the interpolated string template and the values referenced within it to allow for custom processing. In the case of Aspire, these details are captured in a `ReferenceExpression` which can be evaluated as each value referenced in the interpolated string becomes available.

Here's how the flow of execution works:


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
A resource which implements `IResourceWithConnectionString` is added to the model (for example, `AddMailDev(...)`).

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
The `IResourceBuilder<MailDevResource>` is passed to the `WithReference` which has a special overload for handling `IResourceWithConnectionString` implementors.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
The `WithReference` wraps the resource in a `ConnectionStringReference` instance and the object is captured in an `EnvironmentCallbackAnnotation` which is evaluated after the Aspire project is built and starts running.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="4">
As the process that references the connection string starts Aspire starts evaluating the expression. It first gets the `ConnectionStringReference` and calls its `GetValueAsync` method.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="5">
The `GetValueAsync` method gets the value of the `IResourceWithConnectionString.ConnectionStringExpression` property to get the `ReferenceExpression` instance.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="6">
The `ConnectionStringReference.GetValueAsync` method then calls `ReferenceExpression.GetValueAsync` to process the previously captured interpolated string.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="7">
Because the interpolated string contains references to other reference types such as `EndpointReference` they're also evaluated and real value substituted (which at this time is now available).

</Step>
</Steps>

### Publishing and resource expressions

The `IManifestExpressionProvider` interface is designed to solve the problem of sharing connection information between resources at deployment. Similarly to local development, many of the values are necessary to configure the app, yet they can't be determined until the app is being deployed.

Aspire uses expression syntax in published artifacts so that deployment tools can evaluate and resolve connection information. Generally these expressions aren't visible to developers, but you can inspect them by generating a publish-manifest. The command below can be used on the AppHost to produce a manifest.

```bash title="Aspire CLI — publish-manifest"
aspire do publish-manifest --output-path aspire-manifest.json
```

Consider the following example output:

```bash frame=none
09:01:18 (pipeline execution) → Starting pipeline execution...
09:01:18 (publish-manifest) → Starting publish-manifest...
09:01:18 (publish-manifest) i [INF] Published manifest to: ./MailDevResource/aspire-manifest.json
09:01:18 (publish-manifest) ✓ publish-manifest completed successfully
09:01:18 (pipeline execution) ✓ Completed successfully
------------------------------------------------------------
✓ 2/2 steps succeeded • Total time: 0.0s

Steps Summary:
   0.0 s  ✓ pipeline execution
   0.0 s  ✓ publish-manifest

✓ PIPELINE SUCCEEDED
------------------------------------------------------------
```

Navigate to the output file specified in the command to inspect the manifest file. This command produces a manifest file like the following:

```json title="JSON — aspire-manifest.json"
{
  "resources": {
    "maildev": {
      "type": "container.v0",
      "connectionString": "smtp://{maildev.bindings.smtp.host}:{maildev.bindings.smtp.port}",

Because the `MailDevResource` implements `IResourceWithConnectionString` the manifest publishing logic in Aspire knows that even though `MailDevResource` is a container resource, it also needs a `connectionString` field. The `connectionString` field references other parts of the `maildev` resource in the manifest to produce the final string:

```json
{
    // ... other content omitted.
    "connectionString": "smtp://{maildev.bindings.smtp.host}:{maildev.bindings.smtp.port}",
}
```

Aspire knows how to form this string because it looks at `IResourceWithConnectionString.ConnectionStringExpression` and builds up the final string via the `IManifestExpressionProvider` interface (in much the same way as the `IValueProvider` interface is used).

The `MailDevResource` automatically gets included in the manifest because it's derived from `ContainerResource`. Resource authors can choose to suppress outputting content to the manifest by using the `ExcludeFromManifest` extension method on the resource builder.

```diff lang="csharp" title="C# — MailDevResourceBuilderExtensions.cs"
public static IResourceBuilder<MailDevResource> AddMailDev(
    this IDistributedApplicationBuilder builder,
    string name,
    int? httpPort = null,
    int? smtpPort = null)
{
    var resource = new MailDevResource(name);

    return builder.AddResource(resource)
                  .WithImage(MailDevContainerImageTags.Image)
                  .WithImageRegistry(MailDevContainerImageTags.Registry)
                  .WithImageTag(MailDevContainerImageTags.Tag)
                  .WithHttpEndpoint(
                      targetPort: 1080,
                      port: httpPort,
                      name: MailDevResource.HttpEndpointName)
                  .WithEndpoint(
                      targetPort: 1025,
                      port: smtpPort,
                      name: MailDevResource.SmtpEndpointName)
+                  .ExcludeFromManifest(); // This line was added
}
```

Careful consideration should be given as to whether the resource should be present in the manifest, or whether it should be suppressed. If the resource is being added to the manifest, it should be configured in such a way that it's safe and secure to use.

## Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to create a custom Aspire resource which uses an existing containerized application (MailDev). You then used that to improve the local development experience by making it easy to test e-mail capabilities that might be used within an app. These learnings can be applied to building out other custom resources that can be used in Aspire-based applications. This specific example didn't include any custom integrations, but it's possible to build out custom integrations to make it easier for developers to use the resource. In this scenario you were able to rely on the existing `SmtpClient` class in the .NET platform to send e-mails.
