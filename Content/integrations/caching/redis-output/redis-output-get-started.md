The [Redis®](#registered-trademark) output caching integration is used to register an [ASP.NET Core Output Caching](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/performance/caching/output) provider backed by a [Redis](https://redis.io/) server with the [`docker.io/library/redis` container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/).
</IntegrationIcon>

In this introduction, you'll see how to install and use the Aspire Redis Output Caching integrations in a simple configuration. If you already have this knowledge, see [Redis Output Caching hosting integration](/integrations/caching/redis-output/redis-output-host) for full reference details.

> [!NOTE]
> To follow this guide, you must have created an Aspire solution to work with.
>   To learn how to do that, see [Build your first Aspire
>   app](/docs/get-started/first-app).

## Set up hosting integration

To begin, install the Aspire Redis hosting integration in your Aspire AppHost project:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Hosting.Redis" />

Next, in the AppHost project, create instances of Redis resources and pass them to the consuming client projects:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache");

var myService = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
                       .WithReference(cache);

builder.Build().Run();
```

When Aspire adds a container image to the AppHost, it creates a new Redis instance on your local machine.

> [!TIP]
> If you'd rather connect to an existing Redis instance, call `AsExisting`
>   instead.

## Set up client integration

To get started with the Redis output caching integration, install the package:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.StackExchange.Redis.OutputCaching" />

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddRedisOutputCache` extension method to register the required services for output caching:

```csharp
builder.AddRedisOutputCache(connectionName: "cache");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the Redis
>   resource in the AppHost project.

Add the middleware to the request processing pipeline by calling `UseOutputCache`:

```csharp
var app = builder.Build();

app.UseOutputCache();
```

For minimal API apps, configure an endpoint to do caching by calling `CacheOutput`, or by applying the `OutputCacheAttribute`:

```csharp
app.MapGet("/cached", () => "Hello world!")
   .CacheOutput();

app.MapGet(
    "/attribute",
    [OutputCache] () => "Hello world!");
```

For apps with controllers, apply the `[OutputCache]` attribute to the action method. For Razor Pages apps, apply the attribute to the Razor page class.
