The Valkey hosting integration models a Valkey resource as the `ValkeyResource` type. To access this type and APIs, add the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Valkey](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Valkey) NuGet package in your AppHost project:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Hosting.Valkey" />

## Add Valkey resource

In your AppHost project, call `AddValkey` on the builder instance to add a Valkey resource:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddValkey("cache");

var myService = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
                       .WithReference(cache);
```

When Aspire adds a container image to the AppHost, it creates a new Valkey instance on your local machine.

> [!TIP]
> If you'd rather connect to an existing Valkey instance, call `AsExisting`
>   instead.

## Add Valkey resource with data volume

To add a data volume to the Valkey resource, call the `WithDataVolume` method:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddValkey("cache")
                   .WithDataVolume(isReadOnly: false);

var myService = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
                       .WithReference(cache);
```

The data volume is used to persist the Valkey data outside the lifecycle of its container. The data volume is mounted at the `/data` path in the Valkey container.

## Add Valkey resource with data bind mount

To add a data bind mount to the Valkey resource, call the `WithDataBindMount` method:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddValkey("cache")
                   .WithDataBindMount(
                       source: @"C:\Valkey\Data",
                       isReadOnly: false);

var myService = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
                       .WithReference(cache);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Data bind mounts have limited functionality compared to volumes, and when you
>   use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a
>   container.

## Add Valkey resource with persistence

To add persistence to the Valkey resource, call the `WithPersistence` method with either the data volume or data bind mount:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddValkey("cache")
                   .WithDataVolume()
                   .WithPersistence(
                       interval: TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5),
                       keysChangedThreshold: 100);

var myService = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
                       .WithReference(cache);
```

The preceding code adds persistence to the Valkey resource by taking snapshots of the data at a specified interval and threshold.

## Hosting integration health checks

The Valkey hosting integration automatically adds a health check for the Valkey resource. The health check verifies that the Valkey instance is running and that a connection can be established to it.
