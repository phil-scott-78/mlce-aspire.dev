The [Redis®](#registered-trademark) distributed caching integration is used to register an [IDistributedCache](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.caching.distributed.idistributedcache) provider backed by a [Redis](https://redis.io/) server with the [`docker.io/library/redis` container image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/).

In this introduction, you'll see how to install and use the Aspire Redis Distributed Caching integrations in a simple configuration. If you already have this knowledge, see [Redis Distributed Caching hosting integration](/integrations/caching/redis-distributed/redis-distributed-host) for full reference details.

> [!NOTE]
> To follow this guide, you must have created an Aspire solution to work with.
>   To learn how to do that, see [Build your first Aspire
>   app](/docs/get-started/first-app).

## Set up hosting integration

To begin, install the Aspire Redis hosting integration in your Aspire AppHost project:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Hosting.Redis" />

Next, in the AppHost project, create instances of Redis resources and pass them to the consuming client projects:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache");

var myService = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
                       .WithReference(cache);

builder.Build().Run();
```

When Aspire adds a container image to the AppHost, it creates a new Redis instance on your local machine.

> [!TIP]
> If you'd rather connect to an existing Redis instance, call `AsExisting`
>   instead.

## Set up client integration

To get started with the Redis distributed caching integration, install the package:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.StackExchange.Redis.DistributedCaching" />

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddRedisDistributedCache` extension to register the required services for distributed caching:

```csharp
builder.AddRedisDistributedCache(connectionName: "cache");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the Redis
>   resource in the AppHost project.

You can then retrieve the `IDistributedCache` instance using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(IDistributedCache cache)
{
    // Use cache...
}
```
