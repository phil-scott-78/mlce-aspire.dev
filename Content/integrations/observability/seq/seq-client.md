To get started with the Seq client integration, install the [📦 Aspire.Seq](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Seq) NuGet package in the client-consuming project:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Seq" />

## Add a Seq client

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddSeqEndpoint` extension method to register OpenTelemetry Protocol exporters to send logs and traces to Seq:

```csharp
builder.AddSeqEndpoint(connectionName: "seq");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the Seq
>   resource in the AppHost project.

## Connection properties

When you reference a Seq resource using `WithReference`, the following connection properties are made available to the consuming project:

### Seq

The Seq resource exposes the following connection properties:

| Property Name | Description                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Host`        | The hostname or IP address of the Seq server               |
| `Port`        | The port number the Seq server is listening on             |
| `Uri`         | The connection URI, with the format `http://{Host}:{Port}` |

**Example connection string:**

```
Uri: http://localhost:5341
```

> [!NOTE]
> Aspire exposes each property as an environment variable named
>   `[RESOURCE]_[PROPERTY]`. For instance, the `Uri` property of a resource called
>   `seq` becomes `SEQ_URI`.

## Configuration

The Seq integration provides multiple options to configure the connection to Seq.

### Use configuration providers

The Seq integration supports `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`. It loads the `SeqSettings` from configuration using the `Aspire:Seq` key. Example `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Seq": {
      "DisableHealthChecks": true,
      "ServerUrl": "http://localhost:5341"
    }
  }
}
```

### Use named configuration

The Seq integration supports named configuration for multiple instances:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Seq": {
      "seq1": {
        "ServerUrl": "http://seq1:5341",
        "DisableHealthChecks": true
      },
      "seq2": {
        "ServerUrl": "http://seq2:5341",
        "DisableHealthChecks": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use the connection names when calling `AddSeqEndpoint`:

```csharp
builder.AddSeqEndpoint("seq1");
builder.AddSeqEndpoint("seq2");
```

### Use inline delegates

You can pass the `Action<SeqSettings>` delegate to set up options inline:

```csharp
builder.AddSeqEndpoint("seq", static settings =>
{
    settings.DisableHealthChecks  = true;
    settings.ServerUrl = "http://localhost:5341";
});
```

## Client integration health checks

By default, Aspire integrations enable health checks for all services. The Seq integration:

- Adds the health check when `DisableHealthChecks` is `false`, which attempts to connect to the Seq server's `/health` endpoint.
- Integrates with the `/health` HTTP endpoint.

## Observability and telemetry

### Logging

The Seq integration uses the following log categories:

- `Seq`

### Tracing and Metrics

The Seq integration doesn't emit tracing activities or metrics because it's a telemetry sink, not a telemetry source.
