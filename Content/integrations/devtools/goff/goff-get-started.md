Feature flags let you modify system behavior without changing code. Deploy every day, release when you are ready. Reduce risk by releasing your features progressively.

* [GO Feature Flag](https://gofeatureflag.org/) believes in simplicity and offers a simple and lightweight solution to use feature flags.
* Target individual segments, users, and development environments, use advanced rollout functionality.
* 100% Opensource, no vendor locking, supports your favorite languages and is pushing for standardisation with the support of OpenFeature.

In this introduction, you'll see how to install and use the Aspire GO Feature Flag integrations in a simple configuration. If you already have this knowledge, see [GO Feature Flag hosting integration](/integrations/devtools/goff/goff-host) for full reference details.

> [!NOTE]
> To follow this guide, you must have created an Aspire solution to work with. To learn how to do that, see [Build your first Aspire app](/docs/get-started/first-app).

## Set up hosting integration

To begin, install the Aspire GO Feature Flag hosting integration in your Aspire AppHost project:

<InstallPackage PackageName="CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.GoFeatureFlag" />

In your app host project, call `AddGoFeatureFlag` on the builder instance to add a goff container resource:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var goff = builder.AddGoFeatureFlag("goff")
                  .WithGoffBindMount("./goff");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(goff);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

goff uses either the `YAML`, `JSON` or `TOML` format to configure feature flags. The `WithGoffBindMount` method mounts a local folder into the container where goff reads its flag configuration files.

## Set up client integration

Next, install the Aspire GO Feature Flag client integration in your client-consuming project:

<InstallPackage PackageName="CommunityToolkit.Aspire.GoFeatureFlag" />

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddGoFeatureFlagClient` extension method to register a `GoFeatureFlagProvider` for use via the dependency injection container:

```csharp
builder.AddGoFeatureFlagClient(connectionName: "goff");
```

You can then retrieve the `GoFeatureFlagProvider` instance using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the provider from a service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(GoFeatureFlagProvider provider)
{
    // Use provider...
}
```

For full reference details, see [GO Feature Flag hosting integration](/integrations/devtools/goff/goff-host) and [GO Feature Flag client integration](/integrations/devtools/goff/goff-client).
