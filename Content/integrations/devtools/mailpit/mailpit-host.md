To get started with the Aspire Mailpit integrations, follow the [Get started with Mailpit integrations](/integrations/devtools/mailpit/mailpit-get-started) guide.

This article includes full details about the Aspire Mailpit Hosting integration.

## Installation

To access the Mailpit hosting integration APIs for expressing Mailpit resources in your AppHost project, install the [📦 CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.MailPit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.MailPit) NuGet package:

<InstallPackage PackageName="CommunityToolkit.Aspire.Hosting.MailPit" />

## Add Mailpit resource

To add Mailpit to your app host, use the `AddMailPit` extension method:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var mailpit = builder.AddMailPit("mailpit");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(mailpit);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

When Aspire adds Mailpit to the app host, it creates a new Mailpit instance with the `docker.io/axllent/mailpit` container image.

## Ports

Mailpit exposes two ports:

- **SMTP port**: 1025 (for sending emails)
- **Web UI port**: 8025 (for viewing emails in the browser)

Both ports are automatically configured and accessible through the Aspire dashboard.

## Data persistence

To persist emails across container restarts, use the `WithDataVolume` method:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var mailpit = builder.AddMailPit("mailpit")
                     .WithDataVolume();

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(mailpit);
```

The data volume is used to persist the Mailpit data outside the lifecycle of the container.

For development scenarios, you may want to use bind mounts instead of data volumes. To add a data bind mount, call the `WithDataBindMount` method:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var mailpit = builder.AddMailPit("mailpit")
                     .WithDataBindMount(source: @"C:\Mailpit\Data");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
       .WithReference(mailpit);
```

## Web UI

The Mailpit web interface is automatically available when you add a Mailpit resource. You can access it through the Aspire dashboard by clicking on the endpoint for the Mailpit resource.
