<IntegrationIcon Src="/assets/icons/javascript.svg" Alt="JavaScript logo">

The Aspire JavaScript/TypeScript hosting integration enables you to orchestrate JavaScript applications alongside your Aspire projects in the AppHost. This integration provides a unified approach to running JavaScript applications with support for multiple package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, bun), runtimes (Node.js), and build tools (Vite, and more).

> [!CAUTION] Package rename
> In Aspire 13.0, `Aspire.Hosting.NodeJs` was renamed to
> `Aspire.Hosting.JavaScript`.
> 
> Use `Aspire.Hosting.JavaScript` for new and existing Aspire 13+ applications.
> `Aspire.Hosting.NodeJs` is the old package name.

## Hosting integration

To get started with the Aspire JavaScript hosting integration, install the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.JavaScript](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.JavaScript) NuGet package in the AppHost project.

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Hosting.JavaScript" />

The integration exposes a number of app resource types:

- `JavaScriptAppResource`: Added with the `AddJavaScriptApp` method for general JavaScript applications
- `NodeAppResource`: Added with the `AddNodeApp` method for running specific JavaScript files with Node.js
- `ViteAppResource`: Added with the `AddViteApp` method for Vite applications with Vite-specific defaults

## Add JavaScript application

The `AddJavaScriptApp` method is the foundational method for adding JavaScript applications to your Aspire AppHost. It provides a consistent way to orchestrate JavaScript applications with automatic package manager detection and intelligent defaults.

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>();

var frontend = builder.AddJavaScriptApp("frontend", "./frontend")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 3000, env: "PORT")
    .WithReference(api);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

By default, `AddJavaScriptApp`:

- Uses npm as the package manager when `package.json` is present
- Runs the "dev" script during local development
- Runs the "build" script when publishing to create production build output
- Can generate publish-time container build artifacts for that build output

The method accepts the following parameters:

- `name`: The name of the resource in the Aspire dashboard
- `appDirectory`: The path to the directory containing your JavaScript application (where `package.json` is located)
- `runScriptName` (optional): The name of the npm script to run when starting the application. Defaults to 'dev'.

## Add Node.js application

For Node.js applications that don't use a package.json script runner, you can directly run a JavaScript file using the `AddNodeApp` extension method:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>();

var nodeApp = builder.AddNodeApp("node-app", "./node-app", "server.js")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 3000, env: "PORT")
    .WithReference(api);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The `AddNodeApp` method requires:

- **name**: The name of the resource in the Aspire dashboard
- **appDirectory**: The path to the directory containing the node application.
- **scriptPath** The path to the script relative to the app directory to run.

## Add Vite application

For Vite applications, you can use the `AddViteApp` extension method which provides Vite-specific defaults and optimizations:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>();

var viteApp = builder.AddViteApp("vite-app", "./vite-app")
    .WithReference(api);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

`AddViteApp` automatically configures:

- **HTTP endpoint**: Registers an `http` endpoint and sets the `PORT` environment variable — you don't need to call `WithHttpEndpoint` yourself
- **Development script**: Runs the "dev" script (typically `vite`) during local development
- **Build script**: Runs the "build" script (typically `vite build`) when publishing
- **Package manager**: Uses npm by default, but can be customized with `WithYarn()`, `WithPnpm()`, or `WithBun()`

> [!CAUTION]
> Do _not_ call `.WithHttpEndpoint()` on a Vite resource. `AddViteApp` already registers an `http` endpoint with the `PORT` environment variable, and adding another causes a duplicate endpoint error at runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> The Vite dev server is only used for local development. During publish, Aspire
> builds the frontend assets, but another resource must serve those built files in
> production.

The method accepts the same parameters as `AddJavaScriptApp`:

- **name**: The name of the resource in the Aspire dashboard
- **appDirectory**: The path to the directory containing the Vite app.
- **runScriptName** (optional): The name of the script that runs the Vite app. Defaults to "dev".

## Configure package managers

Aspire automatically detects and supports multiple JavaScript package managers with intelligent defaults for both development and production scenarios.

### Auto-install by default

Package managers automatically install dependencies by default. This ensures dependencies are always up-to-date during development and publishing.

### Use npm (default)

npm is the default package manager. If your project has a `package.json` file, Aspire will use npm unless you specify otherwise:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs" "WithNpm"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// npm is used by default
var app = builder.AddJavaScriptApp("app", "./app");

// Customize npm with additional flags
var customApp = builder.AddJavaScriptApp("custom-app", "./custom-app")
    .WithNpm(installCommand: "ci", installArgs: ["--legacy-peer-deps"]);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

When publishing (production mode), Aspire automatically uses `npm ci` if `package-lock.json` exists, otherwise it uses `npm install` for deterministic builds.

### Use yarn

To use yarn as the package manager, call the `WithYarn` extension method:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs" "WithYarn"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.AddJavaScriptApp("app", "./app")
    .WithYarn();

// Customize yarn with additional flags
var customApp = builder.AddJavaScriptApp("custom-app", "./custom-app")
    .WithYarn(installArgs: ["--immutable"]);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

When publishing, Aspire uses:

- `yarn install --immutable` if `yarn.lock` exists and yarn v2+ is detected
- `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` if `yarn.lock` exists with yarn v1
- `yarn install` otherwise

### Use pnpm

To use pnpm as the package manager, call the `WithPnpm` extension method:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs" "WithPnpm"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.AddJavaScriptApp("app", "./app")
    .WithPnpm();

// Customize pnpm with additional flags
var customApp = builder.AddJavaScriptApp("custom-app", "./custom-app")
    .WithPnpm(installArgs: ["--frozen-lockfile"]);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

When publishing, Aspire uses `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` if `pnpm-lock.yaml` exists, otherwise it uses `pnpm install`.

### Use Bun

To use Bun as the package manager, call the `WithBun` extension method:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs" "WithBun"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.AddViteApp("app", "./app")
    .WithBun();

// Customize Bun with additional flags
var customApp = builder.AddViteApp("custom-app", "./custom-app")
    .WithBun(installArgs: ["--frozen-lockfile"]);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

When publishing, Aspire uses `bun install --frozen-lockfile` if `bun.lock` or `bun.lockb` exists, otherwise it uses `bun install`.

Bun supports passing script arguments without the `--` separator, so commands like `bun run dev --port 3000` work without needing `bun run dev -- --port 3000`.

When publishing to a container, `WithBun()` automatically configures a Bun build image (`oven/bun:1`) since Bun is not available in the default Node.js base images. To use a specific Bun version, configure a custom build image:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.AddViteApp("app", "./app")
    .WithBun()
    .WithDockerfileBaseImage(buildImage: "oven/bun:1.1");

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

## Customize scripts

You can customize which scripts run during development and build:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Use different script names
var app = builder.AddJavaScriptApp("app", "./app")
    .WithRunScript("start")      // Run "npm run start" during development instead of "dev"
    .WithBuildScript("prod");    // Run "npm run prod" during publish instead of "build"

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

### Pass arguments to scripts

To pass command-line arguments to your scripts, use the `WithArgs` extension method:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.AddJavaScriptApp("app", "./app")
    .WithRunScript("dev")
    .WithArgs("--port", "3000", "--host");

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

Alternatively, you can define custom scripts in your `package.json` with arguments baked in:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "dev:custom": "vite --port 3000 --host"
  }
}
```

Then reference the custom script:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.AddJavaScriptApp("app", "./app")
    .WithRunScript("dev:custom");

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

## Configure endpoints

JavaScript applications typically use environment variables to configure the port they listen on. Use `WithHttpEndpoint` to configure the port and set the environment variable:

> [!TIP]
> `AddViteApp` already registers an `http` endpoint with the `PORT` environment variable. The following example applies to `AddJavaScriptApp` and `AddNodeApp` only.

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var app = builder.AddJavaScriptApp("app", "./app")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 3000, env: "PORT");

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

Common environment variables for JavaScript frameworks:

- **PORT**: Generic port configuration used by many frameworks (Express, Vite, Next.js)
- **VITE_PORT**: For Vite applications
- **HOST**: Some frameworks also use this to bind to specific interfaces

## Customize Vite configuration

For Vite applications, you can specify a custom configuration file if you need to override the default Vite configuration resolution behavior:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var viteApp = builder.AddViteApp("vite-app", "./vite-app")
    // Path is relative to the Vite service project root
    .WithViteConfig("./vite.production.config.js");

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The `WithViteConfig` method accepts:

- **configPath**: The path to the Vite configuration file, relative to the Vite service project root.

This is useful when you have multiple Vite configuration files for different scenarios (development, staging, production).

### HTTPS configuration

Aspire automatically augments existing Vite configurations to enable HTTPS endpoints at runtime, eliminating manual certificate configuration for development. When you configure HTTPS endpoints on a Vite resource, Aspire dynamically injects the necessary HTTPS configuration:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var viteApp = builder.AddViteApp("vite-app", "./vite-app")
    .WithHttpsEndpoint(env: "PORT")
    .WithHttpsDeveloperCertificate();

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The HTTPS configuration is automatically applied without modifying your `vite.config.js` file. For more information about certificate configuration, see [Certificate configuration](/docs/app-host/configuration/certificate-configuration).

## Pass API URLs to Vite apps

When your Vite app needs to communicate with a backend API, pass the API URL via an environment variable. Vite only exposes variables prefixed with `VITE_` to client-side code.

In your AppHost, expose the API URL to the Vite app using `WithEnvironment`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("api")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints();

var viteApp = builder.AddViteApp("vite-app", "./vite-app")
    .WithReference(api)
    .WithEnvironment("VITE_API_BASE_URL", api.GetEndpoint("https"));

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

In your Vite app, read the variable from `import.meta.env`:

```typescript title="TypeScript — src/api.ts"
const apiBaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL;

export async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch(`${apiBaseUrl}/api/data`);
  return response.json();
}
```

> [!TIP]
> `import.meta.env` variables are replaced at **build time** by Vite. For
>   dynamic runtime values (such as a URL that changes per environment), consider
>   using a server-rendered configuration endpoint instead. See [Pass runtime
>   configuration to SPA frontends](#pass-runtime-configuration-to-spa-frontends).

## Pass runtime configuration to SPA frontends

Vite and other SPA build tools bake environment variables (such as `VITE_*`) into the JavaScript bundle at **build time** (for example, when building the client for production). However, Aspire sets environment variables at **runtime**. This means calling `.WithEnvironment("VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID", parameter)` on a Vite resource won't change values that were already baked into a previously built production bundle.

To bridge this gap, pass the parameter to your API project as a standard environment variable and expose it through a configuration endpoint that the SPA fetches at startup.


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
**Pass the parameter to the API in the AppHost**

Define the parameter in the AppHost and pass it to the API project using `WithEnvironment`. Then reference the API from the frontend so it can call the endpoint:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var googleClientId = builder.AddParameter("google-client-id");

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
    .WithEnvironment("GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID", googleClientId);

var frontend = builder.AddViteApp("frontend", "./frontend")
    .WithPnpm()
    .WithReference(api);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
**Expose a config endpoint in the API**

Create an endpoint in your API project that reads the environment variable from configuration and returns it to the frontend:

```csharp title="C# — Program.cs"
app.MapGet("/api/config/google-client-id", (IConfiguration config) =>
{
    var clientId = config["GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID"];

    return string.IsNullOrEmpty(clientId)
        ? Results.NotFound()
        : Results.Ok(new { clientId });
});
```

> [!CAUTION] Only expose public configuration
> For multiple configuration values, consider grouping them under a single
> endpoint (such as `GET /api/config`) to reduce network requests.
>
> Use this pattern only for non-secret/public configuration values (for
> example OAuth client IDs). Do not expose secrets such as client secrets,
> API keys, or connection strings via a frontend config endpoint.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
**Fetch the config value in the SPA**

In your frontend application, fetch the configuration value at startup instead of reading from `import.meta.env`:

```typescript title="TypeScript — config.ts"
export async function getConfig() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/config/google-client-id');

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to load configuration');
  }

  const { clientId } = await response.json();
  return { googleClientId: clientId };
}
```

</Step>
</Steps>

> [!NOTE]
> This pattern applies to any SPA framework that bakes environment variables at build time, including apps added with `AddViteApp` or `AddJavaScriptApp`. For server-side rendered frameworks (such as Next.js or Nuxt), you can access Aspire environment variables directly with `process.env` at runtime from server-side code paths.
> 
> Environment variables that are bundled into client-side code (for example, `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` in Next.js) are still substituted at build time, so they should use a runtime configuration endpoint like the one shown above if they need values defined by Aspire at app startup.

## Monorepo and Turborepo patterns

Aspire supports **monorepo** layouts where multiple JavaScript apps share a single root workspace. Each app is added as a separate resource in the AppHost pointing to its own subdirectory.

### pnpm workspaces

For a **pnpm** monorepo, install dependencies from the workspace root and reference individual app directories:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("api");

// Each app lives in its own subdirectory with its own package.json
var frontend = builder.AddViteApp("frontend", "./apps/frontend")
    .WithPnpm()
    .WithReference(api);

var dashboard = builder.AddViteApp("dashboard", "./apps/dashboard")
    .WithPnpm()
    .WithReference(api);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

> [!NOTE]
> Each app directory must have its own `package.json` with a `dev` script. The
>   `pnpm install` command should be run from the **monorepo root** before
>   starting Aspire, so that the shared `node_modules` are populated.

### Turborepo

**Turborepo** orchestrates builds across a monorepo. Use a custom run script that delegates to the Turborepo pipeline for a specific app:

```json title="apps/frontend/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "turbo run dev --filter=frontend"
  }
}
```

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("api");

var frontend = builder.AddJavaScriptApp("frontend", "./apps/frontend")
    .WithPnpm()
    .WithRunScript("dev")
    .WithReference(api);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

## Production builds

When you publish your application, Aspire automatically:

1. Generates publish-time build artifacts for containerized deployment
2. Installs dependencies using deterministic install commands based on lockfiles
3. Runs the build script (typically "build") to create production assets
4. Produces frontend build output that another resource can include or serve

This ensures your JavaScript applications are built consistently across
environments and can participate in Aspire publishing workflows.

> [!CAUTION] Production deployment rule
> `AddJavaScriptApp` and `AddViteApp` are not, by themselves, the production web
> server for your frontend.
> 
> During publish, Aspire uses them to build frontend assets. To deploy that
> frontend, you must choose another resource to serve those built files in
> production.
> 
> Adding `AddJavaScriptApp` or `AddViteApp` plus `.WithReference(...)` is not
> enough to make the frontend independently deployable.

> [!NOTE]
> Local Vite proxy and route behavior does not automatically become production
> behavior. If your frontend depends on Vite development-server routing or proxy
> configuration, configure the production-serving resource separately.
