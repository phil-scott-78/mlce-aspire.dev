The Aspire Azure Key Vault client integration is used to connect to an Azure Key Vault service. To get started with the Aspire Azure Key Vault client integration, install the [📦 Aspire.Azure.Security.KeyVault](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Azure.Security.KeyVault) NuGet package:
</IntegrationIcon>

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Azure.Security.KeyVault" />

For an introduction to working with the Azure Key Vault client integration, see [Get started with the Azure Key Vault integration](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-key-vault/azure-key-vault-get-started).

The client integration provides two ways to access secrets from Azure Key Vault:

- Add secrets to app configuration, using either the `IConfiguration` or the `IOptions<T>` pattern.
- Use a `SecretClient` to retrieve secrets on demand.

## Add secrets to configuration

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets` extension method on the `IConfiguration` to add the secrets as part of your app's configuration. The method takes a connection name parameter:

```csharp
builder.Configuration.AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets(connectionName: "key-vault");
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets` API name has caused a bit of confusion. The
>   method is used to configure the `SecretClient` based on the given connection
>   name, and _it's not used_ to add secrets to the configuration.

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the Azure
>   Key Vault resource in the AppHost project. For more information, see [Add
>   Azure Key Vault resource](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-key-vault/azure-key-vault-host/#add-azure-key-vault-resource)

You can then retrieve a secret-based configuration value through the normal `IConfiguration` APIs, or by binding to strongly-typed classes with the options pattern.

### Retrieve `IConfiguration` instance

```csharp
public class ExampleService(IConfiguration configuration)
{
    // Use configuration...
    private string _secretValue = configuration["SecretKey"];
}
```

### Retrieve `IOptions<T>` instance

```csharp
public class ExampleService(IOptions<SecretOptions> options)
{
    // Use options...
    private string _secretValue = options.Value.SecretKey;
}
```

Additional `AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets` API parameters are available optionally for the following scenarios:

- `Action<AzureSecurityKeyVaultSettings>? configureSettings`: To set up some or all the options inline.
- `Action<SecretClientOptions>? configureClientOptions`: To set up the `SecretClientOptions` inline.
- `AzureKeyVaultConfigurationOptions? options`: To configure the `AzureKeyVaultConfigurationOptions` inline.

## Add an Azure Secret client

Alternatively, you can use the `SecretClient` directly to retrieve the secrets on demand. This requires a slightly different registration API.

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddAzureKeyVaultClient` extension on the `IHostApplicationBuilder` instance to register a `SecretClient` for use via the dependency injection container:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureKeyVaultClient(connectionName: "key-vault");
```

After adding the `SecretClient` to the builder, you can get the `SecretClient` instance using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(SecretClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

## Properties of the Azure Key Vault resources

When you use the `WithReference` method to pass an Azure Key Vault resource from the AppHost project to a consuming client project, several properties are available to use in the consuming project.

Aspire exposes each property as an environment variable named `[RESOURCE]_[PROPERTY]`. For instance, the `Uri` property of a resource called `keyvault` becomes `KEYVAULT_URI`.

### Azure Key Vault

The Azure Key Vault resource exposes the following connection property:

| Property Name | Description                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Uri`         | The vault URI (e.g., `https://{name}.vault.azure.net/`)              |

For example, if you reference an Azure Key Vault resource named `keyvault` in your AppHost project, the following environment variables will be available in the consuming project:

- `KEYVAULT_URI`

## Add keyed Azure Key Vault client

There might be situations where you want to register multiple `SecretClient` instances with different connection names. To register keyed Azure Key Vault clients, call the `AddKeyedAzureKeyVaultClient` method:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedAzureKeyVaultClient(name: "feature-toggles");
builder.AddKeyedAzureKeyVaultClient(name: "admin-portal");
```

Then you can retrieve the `SecretClient` instances using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(
    [FromKeyedServices("feature-toggles")] SecretClient featureTogglesClient,
    [FromKeyedServices("admin-portal")] SecretClient adminPortalClient)
{
    // Use clients...
}
```

## Configuration

The Azure Key Vault integration provides multiple options to configure the `SecretClient`.

### Use configuration providers

The Azure Key Vault integration supports `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`. It loads the `AzureSecurityKeyVaultSettings` from `appsettings.json` or other configuration files using `Aspire:Azure:Security:KeyVault` key:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Security": {
        "KeyVault": {
          "DisableHealthChecks": true,
          "DisableTracing": false,
          "ClientOptions": {
            "Diagnostics": {
              "ApplicationId": "myapp"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Use named configuration

The Azure Key Vault integration supports named configuration for multiple instances:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Security": {
        "KeyVault": {
          "vault1": {
            "VaultUri": "https://myvault1.vault.azure.net/",
            "DisableHealthChecks": true,
            "ClientOptions": {
              "Diagnostics": {
                "ApplicationId": "myapp1"
              }
            }
          },
          "vault2": {
            "VaultUri": "https://myvault2.vault.azure.net/",
            "DisableTracing": true,
            "ClientOptions": {
              "Diagnostics": {
                "ApplicationId": "myapp2"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use the connection names when calling `AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets`:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets("vault1");
builder.AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets("vault2");
```

### Use inline delegates

You can also pass the `Action<AzureSecurityKeyVaultSettings>` delegate to set up options inline:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets(
    connectionName: "key-vault",
    configureSettings: settings => settings.VaultUri = new Uri("KEY_VAULT_URI"));
```

You can also configure the `SecretClientOptions`:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureKeyVaultSecrets(
    connectionName: "key-vault",
    configureClientOptions: options => options.DisableChallengeResourceVerification = true);
```

## Configuration options

The following configurable options are exposed through the `AzureSecurityKeyVaultSettings` class:

| Name                  | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Credential`          | The credential used to authenticate to the Azure Key Vault.                                 |
| `DisableHealthChecks` | A boolean value that indicates whether the Key Vault health check is disabled or not.       |
| `DisableTracing`      | A boolean value that indicates whether the OpenTelemetry tracing is disabled or not.        |
| `VaultUri`            | A URI to the vault on which the client operates. Appears as "DNS Name" in the Azure portal. |

## Client integration health checks

By default, Aspire integrations enable health checks for all services. The Azure Key Vault integration includes the following health checks:

- Adds the `AzureKeyVaultSecretsHealthCheck` health check, which attempts to connect to and query the Key Vault
- Integrates with the `/health` HTTP endpoint, which specifies all registered health checks must pass for app to be considered ready to accept traffic

## Observability and telemetry

### Logging

The Azure Key Vault integration uses the following log categories:

- `Azure.Core`
- `Azure.Identity`

### Tracing

The Azure Key Vault integration emits the following tracing activities using OpenTelemetry:

- `Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets.SecretClient`

### Metrics

The Azure Key Vault integration currently doesn't support metrics by default due to limitations with the Azure SDK.
