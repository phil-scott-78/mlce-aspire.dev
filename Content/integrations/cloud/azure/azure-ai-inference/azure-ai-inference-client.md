Two kinds of clients are available in the Aspire Azure AI Inference integration:

- `ChatCompletionsClient`: A client for interacting with a chat completions model.
  - `IChatClient`: An abstraction for chat clients from `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`.
- `EmbeddingsClient`: A client for interacting with a text embeddings model.
  - `IEmbeddingGenerator`: An abstraction for embeddings clients from `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`.

The Aspire Azure AI Inference client integration is used to work with Azure AI models using the `IChatClient` or `IEmbeddingGenerator` abstraction from `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`. To get started, install the [📦 Aspire.Azure.AI.Inference](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Azure.AI.Inference) NuGet package.

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Azure.AI.Inference" />

For an introduction to working with the Azure AI Inference client integration, see [Get started with the Azure AI Inference integrations](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-ai-inference/azure-ai-inference-get-started).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check the model inference tasks for both clients. Some models may only support chat completions, while others may only support embeddings. Ensure that the model you choose aligns with the client you intend to use.
> This information is available in the [model catalog](https://ai.azure.com/resource/models/) and in the Quick facts section of each model's details page.
### Add an Azure AI Inference Chat Completions client

In the _Program.cs_ file of your client-consuming project, use the `AddAzureChatCompletionsClient` method on any `IHostApplicationBuilder` to register a `ChatCompletionsClient` for dependency injection (DI).

```csharp
builder.AddAzureChatCompletionsClient(connectionName: "ai-foundry");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the Azure AI Inference resource in the AppHost project. For more information, see [Connect to an existing Microsoft Foundry service](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-ai-inference/azure-ai-inference-host/#connect-to-an-existing-microsoft-foundry-service).

After adding the `ChatCompletionsClient`, you can retrieve the client instance using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(ChatCompletionsClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

For more information, see:

- [What is Azure AI model inference?](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/supported-languages?view=foundry-classic) for details on Azure AI model inference.
- [Dependency injection in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection) for details on dependency injection.
- [The Microsoft Foundry SDK: C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/sdk-overview?tabs=sync&pivots=programming-language-csharp).

### Add Azure AI Inference Chat Completions client with registered `IChatClient`

If you're interested in using the `IChatClient` interface with the Azure AI Inference client, simply chain either of the following APIs to the `AddAzureChatCompletionsClient` method:

- `AddChatClient`: Registers a singleton `IChatClient` in the services.
- `AddKeyedChatClient`: Registers a keyed singleton `IChatClient` in the services.

For example, consider the following C# code that adds an `IChatClient` to the DI container:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureChatCompletionsClient(connectionName: "ai-foundry")
    .AddChatClient("deploymentName");
```

Similarly, you can add a keyed `IChatClient` with the following C# code:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureChatCompletionsClient(connectionName: "ai-foundry")
    .AddKeyedChatClient("serviceKey", "deploymentName");
```

After adding the `IChatClient`, you can retrieve the client instance using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(IChatClient chatClient)
{
    public async Task<string> GetResponseAsync(string userMessage)
    {
        var response = await chatClient.CompleteAsync(userMessage);
        return response.Message.Text ?? string.Empty;
    }
}
```

For more information on the `IChatClient` and its corresponding library, see [Artificial intelligence in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/ai/microsoft-extensions-ai).

### Add keyed Azure AI Inference Chat Completions clients

There might be situations where you want to register multiple `ChatCompletionsClient` instances with different connection names. To register keyed Azure AI Inference clients, call the `AddKeyedAzureChatCompletionsClient` method:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedAzureChatCompletionsClient(name: "chat");
builder.AddKeyedAzureChatCompletionsClient(name: "code");
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using keyed services, ensure that your Azure AI Inference resource configures two named connections, one for `chat` and one for `code`.

Then you can retrieve the client instances using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the clients from a service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(
    [KeyedService("chat")] ChatCompletionsClient chatClient,
    [KeyedService("code")] ChatCompletionsClient codeClient)
{
    // Use clients...
}
```

For more information, see [Keyed services in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#keyed-services).

### Add an Azure AI Inference Embeddings client

In the _Program.cs_ file of your client-consuming project, use the `AddAzureEmbeddingsClient` method on any `IHostApplicationBuilder` to register an `EmbeddingsClient` for dependency injection (DI).

```csharp
builder.AddAzureEmbeddingsClient(connectionName: "ai-foundry");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the Azure AI Inference resource in the AppHost project. For more information, see [Connect to an existing Microsoft Foundry service](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-ai-inference/azure-ai-inference-host/#connect-to-an-existing-microsoft-foundry-service).

After adding the `EmbeddingsClient`, you can retrieve the client instance using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(EmbeddingsClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

For more information, see:

- [What is Azure AI model inference?](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-models/supported-languages?view=foundry-classic) for details on Azure AI model inference.
- [Dependency injection in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection) for details on dependency injection.
- [The Microsoft Foundry SDK: C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/sdk-overview?tabs=sync&pivots=programming-language-csharp).

### Add Azure AI Inference Embeddings client with registered `IEmbeddingGenerator`

If you're interested in using the `IEmbeddingGenerator` interface with the Azure AI Inference client, simply chain either of the following APIs to the `AddAzureEmbeddingsClient` method:

- `AddEmbeddingsClient`: Registers a singleton `IEmbeddingGenerator` in the services.
- `AddKeyedEmbeddingsClient`: Registers a keyed singleton `IEmbeddingGenerator` in the services.

For example, consider the following C# code that adds an `IEmbeddingGenerator` to the DI container:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureEmbeddingsClient(connectionName: "ai-foundry")
    .AddEmbeddingsClient("deploymentName");
```

Similarly, you can add a keyed `IEmbeddingGenerator` with the following C# code:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureEmbeddingsClient(connectionName: "ai-foundry")
    .AddKeyedEmbeddingsClient("serviceKey", "deploymentName");
```

After adding the `IEmbeddingGenerator`, you can retrieve the client instance using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(IEmbeddingGenerator<string, Embedding<float>> embeddingGenerator)
{
    public async Task<GeneratedEmbeddings<Embedding<float>>> GenerateEmbeddingsAsync(string input)
    {
        return await embeddingGenerator.GenerateAsync(input);
    }
}
```

For more information on the `IEmbeddingGenerator` and its corresponding library, see [Artificial intelligence in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/artificial-intelligence).

### Add keyed Azure AI Inference Embeddings clients

There might be situations where you want to register multiple `EmbeddingsClient` instances with different connection names. To register keyed Azure AI Inference clients, call the `AddKeyedAzureEmbeddingsClient` method:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedAzureEmbeddingsClient(name: "legal");
builder.AddKeyedAzureEmbeddingsClient(name: "code");
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using keyed services, ensure that your Azure AI Inference resource configures two named connections, one for `legal` and one for `code`.

Then you can retrieve the client instances using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the clients from a service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(
    [KeyedService("legal")] EmbeddingsClient legalClient,
    [KeyedService("code")] EmbeddingsClient codeClient)
{
    // Use clients...
}
```

For more information, see [Keyed services in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#keyed-services).

### Configuration

The Azure AI Inference library provides multiple options to configure the Microsoft Foundry Service based on the requirements and conventions of your project.

> [!NOTE]
> Either an `Endpoint` and `DeploymentId`, or a `ConnectionString` is required to be supplied.

#### Use a connection string

A connection can be constructed from the `Keys`, `Deployment ID` and `Endpoint` tab with the format:

```plaintext
Endpoint={endpoint};Key={key};DeploymentId={deploymentId}`
```

You can provide the name of the connection string when calling `builder.AddAzureChatCompletionsClient()`:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureChatCompletionsClient(
    connectionName: "connection-string-name");
```

The connection string is retrieved from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section. Two connection formats are supported:

##### Microsoft Foundry endpoint

The recommended approach is to use an `Endpoint`, which works with the `ChatCompletionsClientSettings.Credential` property to establish a connection. If no credential is configured, a [default credential](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-default-credential) is used.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "connection-string-name": "Endpoint=https://{endpoint}/;DeploymentId={deploymentName}"
  }
}
```

##### Connection string

Alternatively, a custom connection string can be used.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "connection-string-name": "Endpoint=https://{endpoint}/;Key={account_key};DeploymentId={deploymentName}"
  }
}
```

#### Use configuration providers

The Azure AI Inference library supports `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`. It loads the `ChatCompletionsClientSettings` and `AzureAIInferenceClientOptions` from configuration by using the `Aspire:Azure:AI:Inference` key. For example, consider an _appsettings.json_ that configures some of the options:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "AI": {
        "Inference": {
          "DisableTracing": false,
          "EnableSensitiveTelemetryData": false,
          "ClientOptions": {
            "UserAgentApplicationId": "myapp"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Use inline delegates

You can also pass the `Action<ChatCompletionsClientSettings> configureSettings` delegate to set up some or all the options inline, for example, to disable tracing from code:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureChatCompletionsClient(
    connectionName: "connection-string-name",
    static settings => settings.DisableTracing = true);
```

Aspire integrations automatically set up Logging, Tracing, and Metrics configurations, which are sometimes known as _the pillars of observability_. For more information about integration observability and telemetry, see [Aspire integrations overview](/integrations/overview). Depending on the backing service, some integrations may only support some of these features. For example, some integrations support logging and tracing, but not metrics. Telemetry features can also be disabled using the techniques presented in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

### Logging

The Azure AI Inference integration uses the following log categories:

- `Azure.Core`
- `Azure.Identity`

### Tracing

The Azure AI Inference integration will emit the following tracing activities using OpenTelemetry:

- `Experimental.Microsoft.Extensions.AI` - Used by Microsoft.Extensions.AI to record AI operations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Telemetry is only recorded by default when using the `IChatClient` interface from Microsoft.Extensions.AI. Raw `ChatCompletionsClient` calls do not automatically generate telemetry.

#### Configuring sensitive data in telemetry

By default, telemetry includes metadata such as token counts, but not raw inputs and outputs like message content. To include potentially sensitive information in telemetry, set the `EnableSensitiveTelemetryData` configuration option:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureChatCompletionsClient(
    connectionName: "ai-foundry",
    configureSettings: settings =>
    {
        settings.EnableSensitiveTelemetryData = true;
    })
    .AddChatClient("deploymentName");
```

Or through configuration:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "AI": {
        "Inference": {
          "EnableSensitiveTelemetryData": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can enable sensitive data capture by setting the environment variable:

```bash
OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT=true
```

#### Using underlying library telemetry

If you need to access telemetry from the underlying Azure AI Inference library directly, you can manually add the appropriate activity sources and meters to your OpenTelemetry configuration:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .WithTracing(tracing => tracing.AddSource("Azure.AI.Inference.*"))
    .WithMetrics(metrics => metrics.AddMeter("Azure.AI.Inference.*"));
```

However, you'll need to enable experimental telemetry support in the Azure AI Inference library by setting the `AZURE_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_ACTIVITY_SOURCE` environment variable to `"true"` or calling `AppContext.SetSwitch("Azure.Experimental.EnableActivitySource", true)` during app startup.
