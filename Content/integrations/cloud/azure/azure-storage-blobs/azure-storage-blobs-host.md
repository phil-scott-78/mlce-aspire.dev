## Hosting integration

The Aspire [Azure Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/) hosting integration models the various storage resources as the following types:

- `AzureStorageResource`: Represents an Azure Storage resource.
- `AzureStorageEmulatorResource`: Represents an Azure Storage emulator resource (Azurite).
- `AzureBlobStorageResource`: Represents an Azure Blob storage resource.

To access these types and APIs for expressing them, add the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Storage](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Storage) NuGet package in the [AppHost](/docs/fundamentals/core-concepts/app-host) project.

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Hosting.Azure.Storage" />

### Add Azure Blob Storage resource

In your AppHost project, register the Azure Blob Storage integration by chaining a call to `AddBlobs` on the `IResourceBuilder<IAzureStorageResource>` instance returned by `AddAzureStorage`. The following example demonstrates how to add an Azure Blob Storage resource named `storage` and a blob container named `blobs`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var blobs = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage")
    .RunAsEmulator(azurite => { /* optional azurite configuration */ })
    .AddBlobs("blobs");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
    .WithReference(blobs)
    .WaitFor(blobs);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code:

- Adds an Azure Storage resource named `storage`.
- Chains a call to `RunAsEmulator` to configure the storage resource to run locally using an emulator. The emulator in this case is [Azurite](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite).
- Adds a blob container named `blobs` to the storage resource.
- Adds the `blobs` resource to the `ExampleProject` and waits for it to be ready before starting the project.

> [!CAUTION]
> When you call `AddAzureStorage`, it implicitly calls `AddAzureProvisioning`—which adds support for generating Azure resources dynamically during app startup. The app must configure the appropriate subscription and location. For more information, see [Local provisioning: Configuration](/integrations/cloud/azure/local-provisioning/#configuration).

### Connect to an existing Azure Storage account

You might have an existing Azure Storage account that you want to connect to. You can chain a call to annotate that your `AzureStorageResource` is an existing resource:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var existingStorageName = builder.AddParameter("existingStorageName");
var existingStorageResourceGroup = builder.AddParameter("existingStorageResourceGroup");

var storageaccount = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage")
    .AsExisting(existingStorageName, existingStorageResourceGroup)
    .AddBlobs("blobs");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
    .WithReference(storageaccount);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you call `RunAsExisting`, `PublishAsExisting`, or `AsExisting` methods to work with resources that are already present in your Azure subscription, you must add certain configuration values to your AppHost to ensure that Aspire can locate them. The necessary configuration values include **SubscriptionId**, **AllowResourceGroupCreation**, **ResourceGroup**, and **Location**. If you don't set them, "Missing configuration" errors appear in the Aspire dashboard. For more information about how to set them, see [Use existing Azure resources](/integrations/cloud/azure/overview/#use-existing-azure-resources).

#### Configure Azurite container

There are various configurations available to container resources, for example, you can configure the container's ports, environment variables, it's lifetime, and more.

##### Configure Azurite container ports

By default, the Azurite container when configured by Aspire, exposes the following endpoints:

| Endpoint | Container port | Host port |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| `blob`   | 10000          | dynamic   |
| `queue`  | 10001          | dynamic   |
| `table`  | 10002          | dynamic   |

The port that they're listening on is dynamic by default. When the container starts, the ports are mapped to a random port on the host machine. To configure the endpoint ports, chain calls on the container resource builder provided by the `RunAsEmulator` method as shown in the following example:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage")
  .RunAsEmulator(azurite =>
  {
      azurite.WithBlobPort(27000)
             .WithQueuePort(27001)
             .WithTablePort(27002);
  });

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code configures the Azurite container's existing `blob`, `queue`, and `table` endpoints to listen on ports `27000`, `27001`, and `27002`, respectively. The Azurite container's ports are mapped to the host ports as shown in the following table:

| Endpoint name | Port mapping (`container:host`) |
|--------------:|---------------------------------|
| `blob`        | `10000:27000`                   |
| `queue`       | `10001:27001`                   |
| `table`       | `10002:27002`                   |

##### Configure Azurite container with persistent lifetime

To configure the Azurite container with a persistent lifetime, call the `WithLifetime` method on the Azurite container resource and pass `ContainerLifetime.Persistent`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage")
    .RunAsEmulator(azurite =>
    {
        azurite.WithLifetime(ContainerLifetime.Persistent);
    });

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

##### Configure Azurite container with data volume

To add a data volume to the Azure Storage emulator resource, call the `WithDataVolume` method on the Azure Storage emulator resource:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage")
    .RunAsEmulator(azurite =>
    {
        azurite.WithDataVolume();
    });

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The data volume is used to persist the Azurite data outside the lifecycle of its container. The data volume is mounted at the `/data` path in the Azurite container and when a `name` parameter isn't provided, the name is formatted as `.azurite/{resource name}`. For more information on data volumes and details on why they're preferred over [bind mounts](#configure-azurite-container-with-data-bind-mount), see [Docker docs: Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes).

##### Configure Azurite container with data bind mount

To add a data bind mount to the Azure Storage emulator resource, call the `WithDataBindMount` method:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage")
    .RunAsEmulator(azurite =>
    {
        azurite.WithDataBindMount("../azurite/data");
    });

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Data [bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts/) have limited functionality compared to [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/), which offer better performance, portability, and security, making them more suitable for production environments. However, bind mounts allow direct access and modification of files on the host system, ideal for development and testing where real-time changes are needed.

Data bind mounts rely on the host machine's filesystem to persist the Azurite data across container restarts. The data bind mount is mounted at the `../azurite/data` path on the host machine relative to the AppHost directory (`IDistributedApplicationBuilder.AppHostDirectory`) in the Azurite container. For more information on data bind mounts, see [Docker docs: Bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/bind-mounts).

### Connect to storage resources

When the Aspire AppHost runs, the storage resources can be accessed by external tools, such as the [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/). If your storage resource is running locally using Azurite, it will automatically be picked up by the Azure Storage Explorer.

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Storage Explorer discovers Azurite storage resources assuming the default ports are used. If you've [configured the Azurite container to use different ports](#configure-azurite-container-ports), you'll need to configure the Azure Storage Explorer to connect to the correct ports.

To connect to the storage resource from Azure Storage Explorer, follow these steps:


<Steps>
<Step stepNumber="1">
Run the Aspire AppHost.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="2">
Open the Azure Storage Explorer.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="3">
View the **Explorer** pane.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="4">
Select the **Refresh all** link to refresh the list of storage accounts.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="5">
Expand the **Emulator & Attached** node.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="6">
Expand the **Storage Accounts** node.

</Step>
<Step stepNumber="7">
You should see a storage account with your resource's name as a prefix:

![Azure Storage Explorer: Azurite storage resource discovered.](/assets/integrations/cloud/azure/storage/azure-storage-explorer.png)

</Step>
</Steps>

You're free to explore the storage account and its contents using the Azure Storage Explorer. For more information on using the Azure Storage Explorer, see [Get started with Storage Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/storage-explorer/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer).

### Provisioning-generated Bicep

If you're new to [Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview), it's a domain-specific language for defining Azure resources. With Aspire, you don't need to write Bicep by-hand—the provisioning APIs generate Bicep for you. When you publish your app, the generated Bicep is output alongside the manifest file. When you add an Azure Storage resource with blob storage, the following Bicep is generated:

```bicep title="Generated Bicep — storage.bicep"
@description('The location for the resource(s) to be deployed.')
param location string = resourceGroup().location

param principalId string

param principalType string

resource storage 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2024-01-01' = {
  name: take('storage${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}', 24)
  kind: 'StorageV2'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_GRS'
  }
  properties: {
    accessTier: 'Hot'
    allowSharedKeyAccess: false
    minimumTlsVersion: 'TLS1_2'
    networkAcls: {
      defaultAction: 'Allow'
    }
  }
  tags: {
    'aspire-resource-name': 'storage'
  }
}

resource blobs 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices@2024-01-01' = {
  name: 'default'
  parent: storage
}

resource storage_StorageBlobDataContributor 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2022-04-01' = {
  name: guid(storage.id, principalId, subscriptionResourceId('Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions', 'ba92f5b4-2d11-453d-a403-e96b0029c9fe'))
  properties: {
    principalId: principalId
    roleDefinitionId: subscriptionResourceId('Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions', 'ba92f5b4-2d11-453d-a403-e96b0029c9fe')
    principalType: principalType
  }
  scope: storage
}

output blobEndpoint string = storage.properties.primaryEndpoints.blob

output name string = storage.name
```

The preceding Bicep provisions an Azure Storage account with a blob service, Standard GRS redundancy, TLS 1.2 minimum, and role assignments for blob data access.

The generated Bicep is a starting point and is influenced by changes to the provisioning infrastructure in C#. Customizations to the Bicep file directly will be overwritten, so make changes through the C# provisioning APIs to ensure they are reflected in the generated files.

#### Customize provisioning infrastructure

All Aspire Azure resources are subclasses of the `AzureProvisioningResource` type. This type enables the customization of the generated Bicep by providing a fluent API to configure the Azure resources using the `ConfigureInfrastructure` API. For example, you can configure the `sku`, `accessTier`, and more. The following example demonstrates how to customize the Azure Storage resource:

```csharp title="AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage")
    .ConfigureInfrastructure(infra =>
    {
        var storageAccount = infra.GetProvisionableResources()
            .OfType<StorageAccount>()
            .Single();

        storageAccount.Sku = new StorageSku { Name = StorageSkuName.PremiumLrs };
        storageAccount.AccessTier = StorageAccountAccessTier.Premium;
        storageAccount.Tags.Add("environment", "production");
    });

var blobs = storage.AddBlobs("blobs");
```

The preceding code:

- Chains a call to the `ConfigureInfrastructure` API:
  - The `infra` parameter is an instance of the `AzureResourceInfrastructure` type.
  - The provisionable resources are retrieved by calling `GetProvisionableResources`.
  - The `StorageAccount` is configured with Premium LRS storage and a custom tag.

For more information, see [Customize Azure resources](/integrations/cloud/azure/customize-resources). For the full list of configurable properties, see the [Azure.Provisioning.Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.provisioning.storage) API documentation.

### Connection properties

When you reference Azure Storage resources using `WithReference`, the following connection properties are made available to the consuming project:

#### Azure Storage

The Azure Storage account resource doesn't expose any connection property, reference sub-resources:

#### Blob Storage

The Blob Storage resource exposes the following connection properties:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `Uri` | The URI of the blob storage service, with the format `https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/` |
| `ConnectionString` | **Emulator only.** The connection string for the blob storage service |

#### Blob Container

The Blob Container resource inherits all properties from its parent `AzureBlobStorageResource` and adds:

| Property Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `BlobContainerName` | The name of the blob container |

> [!NOTE]
> Aspire exposes each property as an environment variable named `[RESOURCE]_[PROPERTY]`. For instance, the `Uri` property of a resource called `blobs1` becomes `BLOBS1_URI`.
