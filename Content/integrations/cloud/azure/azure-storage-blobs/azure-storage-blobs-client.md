## Client integration

To get started with the Aspire Azure Blob Storage client integration, install the [📦 Aspire.Azure.Storage.Blobs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Azure.Storage.Blobs) NuGet package:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Azure.Storage.Blobs" />

### Add Azure Blob Storage client

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddAzureBlobServiceClient` extension method to register a `BlobServiceClient` for dependency injection. The method takes a connection name parameter:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureBlobServiceClient("blobs");
```

You can then retrieve the `BlobServiceClient` instance using dependency injection:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(BlobServiceClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

## Properties of the Azure Blob Storage resources

When you use the `WithReference` method to pass an Azure Blob Storage resource from the AppHost project to a consuming client project, several properties are available to use in the consuming project.

Aspire exposes each property as an environment variable named `[RESOURCE]_[PROPERTY]`. For instance, the `Uri` property of a resource called `blobs` becomes `BLOBS_URI`.

### Azure Blob Storage

The Azure Blob Storage resource exposes the following connection properties:

| Property Name | Description                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `Uri`         | The blob service endpoint    |

In emulator mode, an additional property is available:

| Property Name      | Description                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `ConnectionString` | The full connection string for the emulator |

For example, if you reference a Blob Storage resource named `blobs` in your AppHost project, the following environment variables will be available in the consuming project:

- `BLOBS_URI`

### Configuration

The Azure Blob Storage integration provides multiple options to configure the `BlobServiceClient`.

#### Use a connection string

When using a connection string from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section, provide the name when calling `AddAzureBlobServiceClient`:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureBlobServiceClient("blobs");
```

Two connection formats are supported:

##### Service URI

The recommended approach is to use a `ServiceUri`, which works with the `Credential` property. If no credential is configured, a [default credential](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-default-credential) is used:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "blobs": "https://{account_name}.blob.core.windows.net/"
  }
}
```

##### Connection string

Alternatively, an [Azure Storage connection string](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-configure-connection-string) can be used:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "blobs": "AccountName=myaccount;AccountKey=myaccountkey"
  }
}
```

#### Use configuration providers

The Azure Blob Storage integration supports `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`. It loads the `AzureStorageBlobsSettings` and `BlobClientOptions` from configuration using the `Aspire:Azure:Storage:Blobs` key. Example `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Storage": {
        "Blobs": {
          "DisableHealthChecks": true,
          "DisableTracing": false,
          "ClientOptions": {
            "Diagnostics": {
              "ApplicationId": "myapp"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Use named configuration

The Azure Blob Storage integration supports named configuration for multiple instances:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Storage": {
        "Blobs": {
          "blob1": {
            "DisableHealthChecks": true,
            "ClientOptions": {
              "Diagnostics": {
                "ApplicationId": "myapp1"
              }
            }
          },
          "blob2": {
            "DisableTracing": true,
            "ClientOptions": {
              "Diagnostics": {
                "ApplicationId": "myapp2"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use the connection names when calling `AddAzureBlobServiceClient`:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureBlobServiceClient("blob1");
builder.AddAzureBlobServiceClient("blob2");
```

#### Use inline delegates

You can also pass the `Action<AzureStorageBlobsSettings>` delegate to set up options inline:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureBlobServiceClient(
    "blobs",
    settings => settings.DisableHealthChecks = true);
```

You can also configure the `BlobClientOptions`:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureBlobServiceClient(
    "blobs",
    configureClientBuilder: clientBuilder =>
        clientBuilder.ConfigureOptions(
            options => options.Diagnostics.ApplicationId = "myapp"));
```

### Client integration health checks

By default, Aspire integrations enable health checks for all services. The Azure Blob Storage integration:

- Adds the health check when `DisableHealthChecks` is `false`, which attempts to connect to the Azure Blob Storage.
- Integrates with the `/health` HTTP endpoint, which specifies all registered health checks must pass for app to be considered ready to accept traffic.

### Observability and telemetry

#### Logging

The Azure Blob Storage integration uses the following log categories:

- `Azure.Core`
- `Azure.Identity`

#### Tracing

The Azure Blob Storage integration emits the following tracing activities using OpenTelemetry:

- `Azure.Storage.Blobs.BlobContainerClient`

#### Metrics

The Azure Blob Storage integration currently doesn't support metrics by default due to limitations with the Azure SDK.
