When an Aspire Azure client integration needs to authenticate with an Azure service, it uses a credential. If no credential is explicitly configured, Aspire uses a default credential that is optimized for both local development and production environments in Azure.

## Default credential behavior

Starting in Aspire 13.2, the default credential behavior was updated to follow [Azure SDK authentication best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication/credential-chains?tabs=dac#usage-guidance-for-defaultazurecredential) and [use deterministic credentials in production environments](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication/best-practices#use-deterministic-credentials-in-production-environments). Rather than using the parameterless `DefaultAzureCredential` constructor, Aspire detects the runtime environment and selects the most appropriate credential:

- **`AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS` is set**: When the `AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is present, a `DefaultAzureCredential` is created using that environment variable to [customize the credential chain](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication/credential-chains#how-to-customize-defaultazurecredential). Aspire's Azure hosting integrations set this variable automatically when deploying to Azure Container Apps or Azure App Service.
- **Running in Azure** (without `AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS`): When Aspire detects that the application is running in Azure by the presence of the `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable, it uses `ManagedIdentityCredential`. This ensures deterministic, efficient authentication in production.
- **Local development**: When no Azure environment is detected, a `DefaultAzureCredential` configured for development is used. This credential excludes `EnvironmentCredential`, `WorkloadIdentityCredential`, and `ManagedIdentityCredential`—leaving only credentials applicable to developer machines, such as the Azure CLI, Visual Studio, or Azure Developer CLI credentials.

> [!CAUTION] Breaking change in Aspire 13.2
> This is a breaking change for anyone depending on credentials other than `ManagedIdentityCredential` working in an Azure service. For example, if your application relies on `EnvironmentCredential` or `WorkloadIdentityCredential` in an Azure-hosted environment, you need to explicitly configure the credential.

## Override the default credential

If you need to use a different credential in your application, you can provide your own by configuring the integration's settings. For example, to use `EnvironmentCredential` with Azure Blob Storage:

```csharp title="C# — Program.cs"
builder.AddAzureBlobServiceClient(
    "blobs",
    settings =>
    {
        settings.Credential = new EnvironmentCredential();
    });
```

Each Aspire Azure client integration exposes a `Credential` property in its settings that you can set to any `TokenCredential` instance.
