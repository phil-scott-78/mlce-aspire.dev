<Badge text="🧪 Preview" variant="note" size="large" />

The Aspire Azure App Service hosting integration models App Service resources as the `AzureAppServiceResource` type. To access this type and APIs for expressing them within your AppHost project, install the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppService](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppService) NuGet package:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppService" />

## Add Azure App Service environment

To use Azure App Service with Aspire, you first add an App Service environment to your AppHost project. The environment represents the hosting infrastructure (App Service Plan) where your apps will run.

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var appServiceEnv = builder.AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment("app-service-env");

// Add other resources to the app model

builder.Build().Run();
```

The preceding code creates a new Azure App Service environment named `app-service-env`. When you run your app locally, this environment is provisioned in your Azure subscription with the following resources:

- An App Service Plan with a Premium P0V3 tier on Linux.
- An Azure Container Registry (Basic SKU) for container image storage.
- A user-assigned managed identity for secure access to the container registry.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you call `AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment`, it implicitly calls `AddAzureProvisioning`—which adds support for generating Azure resources dynamically during app startup. The app must configure the appropriate subscription and location. For more information, see [Local provisioning: Configuration](/integrations/cloud/azure/local-provisioning/#configuration).

## Connect to an existing Azure App Service plan

You might have an existing Azure App Service plan that you want to use. Chain a call to annotate that your `AzureAppServiceEnvironmentResource` is an existing resource:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var existingAppServicePlanName = builder.AddParameter("existingAppServicePlanName");
var existingResourceGroup = builder.AddParameter("existingResourceGroup");

var appServiceEnv = builder.AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment("app-service-env")
    .AsExisting(existingAppServicePlanName, existingResourceGroup);

builder.AddProject<Projects.WebApi>("api")
    .PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite((infra, website) =>
    {
        // Optional: customize the Azure App Service website here
    });

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

For more information on treating Azure App Service resources as existing resources, see [Use existing Azure resources](/integrations/cloud/azure/overview/#use-existing-azure-resources).

## Publish resources as Azure App Service websites

After adding an App Service environment, you can publish compute resources (`IComputeResource`) as Azure App Service websites using the `PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite` method.

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var appServiceEnv = builder.AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment("app-service-env");

builder.AddProject<Projects.WebApi>("api")
    .PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite((infra, website) =>
    {
        // Optional: customize the Azure App Service website here
    });

builder.Build().Run();
```

The preceding code:

- Creates an Azure App Service environment named `app-service-env`.
- Adds a project named `api` to the AppHost.
- Configures the project to be published as an Azure App Service website.
- Provides an optional callback to customize the website configuration.

During local development (when running with ), the project runs locally. When you publish your app, the project is deployed as an Azure App Service website within the provisioned environment.

> [!NOTE]
> When you publish resources to Azure App Service using the
>   `PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite` method, Aspire automatically sets the
>   `AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to `managedidentity`. This
>   ensures that `DefaultAzureCredential` uses only `ManagedIdentityCredential`
>   for authentication, following [Azure SDK best
>   practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/azure/sdk/authentication/best-practices?tabs=aspdotnet#use-deterministic-credentials-in-production-environments).
>   If you need to use a different credential type, you can remove this
>   environment variable in the `PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite` callback. For
>   more information, see [DefaultAzureCredential behavior in Azure
>   deployments](/docs/whats-new/aspire-13/#defaultazurecredential-behavior-in-azure-deployments).

## Customize the App Service website

The `PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite` method accepts a callback that allows you to customize the Azure App Service website configuration using the [Azure.Provisioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.provisioning) APIs:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddProject<Projects.WebApi>("api")
    .PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite((infra, website) =>
    {
        website.AppSettings.Add("ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT", new AppServiceConfigurationSetting
        {
            Name = "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT",
            Value = "Production"
        });

        website.Tags.Add("Environment", "Production");
        website.Tags.Add("Team", "Engineering");
    });
```

The preceding code:

- Chains a call to `PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite` with a customization callback.
- Adds an application setting for `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT`.
- Adds multiple tags for metadata and organization.

## Deployment slots

[Deployment slots](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-staging-slots) let you deploy your app to a staging environment for testing before swapping it into production. The `WithDeploymentSlot` extension method configures a deployment slot for the App Service environment:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment("appservice")
    .WithDeploymentSlot("staging");

var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("apiservice")
    .WithHttpHealthCheck("/health")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints();

builder.AddProject<Projects.Web>("webfrontend")
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints()
    .WithHttpHealthCheck("/health")
    .WithReference(apiService)
    .WaitFor(apiService);

builder.Build().Run();
```

The preceding code configures all App Service websites to be deployed to a `staging` slot.

### Deployment slot behavior

When you deploy to a slot, the deployment behavior depends on whether the production App Service already exists:

- **New App Service**: If the production App Service (production slot) doesn't exist at the time of deployment, Aspire deploys to both the production App Service and the specified deployment slot.
- **Existing App Service**: If the production App Service already exists, Aspire deploys only to the specified deployment slot.

This behavior allows you to safely deploy and test changes in a staging environment before swapping to production.

### Using parameters for deployment slots

You can also specify the deployment slot value as a parameter, allowing the slot name to be provided at deployment time:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var slotName = builder.AddParameter("deploymentSlot");

builder.AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment("appservice")
    .WithDeploymentSlot(slotName);

// Add your projects and other resources...

builder.Build().Run();
```

With this configuration, you can specify the slot name when running `aspire deploy` by providing a value for the `deploymentSlot` parameter.

### Applying customizations to slots

> [!CAUTION]
> Customizations applied to the production App Service are not automatically applied to deployment slots. You must explicitly apply any customizations to the slot as well.

When you customize App Service resources using `PublishAsAzureAppServiceWebsite` or `ConfigureInfrastructure`, those customizations apply to the production slot by default. If you need the same customizations on your deployment slot, you must apply them separately. This gives you fine-grained control over the configuration of each slot, allowing staging and production environments to have different settings when needed.

## Provisioning-generated Bicep

If you're new to [Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview), it's a domain-specific language for defining Azure resources. With Aspire, you don't need to write Bicep by-hand, instead the provisioning APIs generate Bicep for you. When you publish your app, the generated Bicep is output alongside the manifest file.

When you add an Azure App Service environment, the following key resources are provisioned:

- **App Service Plan**: A Premium P0V3 Linux-based hosting plan.
- **Azure Container Registry**: A Basic SKU registry for storing container images.
- **User-assigned Managed Identity**: For secure access between App Service and Container Registry.
- **Role Assignments**: ACR Pull role assigned to the managed identity.

The generated Bicep is a starting point and is influenced by changes to the provisioning infrastructure in C#. Customizations to the Bicep file directly are overwritten, so make changes through the C# provisioning APIs to ensure they're reflected in the generated files.

## Customize provisioning infrastructure

All Aspire Azure resources are subclasses of the `AzureProvisioningResource` type. This type enables the customization of the generated Bicep by providing a fluent API to configure the Azure resources—using the `ConfigureInfrastructure` API. For example, you can configure the App Service Plan SKU, location, and more. The following example demonstrates how to customize the Azure App Service environment:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var appServiceEnv = builder.AddAzureAppServiceEnvironment("app-service-env")
    .ConfigureInfrastructure(infra =>
    {
        var resources = infra.GetProvisionableResources();
        var plan = resources.OfType<AppServicePlan>().Single();

        plan.Sku = new AppServiceSkuDescription
        {
            Name = "P1V3",
            Tier = "Premium"
        };

        plan.Tags.Add("Environment", "Production");
        plan.Tags.Add("CostCenter", "Engineering");
    });

builder.Build().Run();
```

The preceding code:

- Chains a call to the `ConfigureInfrastructure` API:
  - The `infra` parameter is an instance of the `AzureResourceInfrastructure` type.
  - The provisionable resources are retrieved by calling the `GetProvisionableResources` method.
  - The single `AppServicePlan` is retrieved.
  - The `Sku` property is changed to a P1V3 tier.
  - Tags are added to the App Service Plan for metadata and organization.

There are many more configuration options available to customize the App Service environment. For more information, see `Azure.Provisioning.AppService` and [Azure.Provisioning customization](/integrations/cloud/azure/customize-resources/#azureprovisioning-customization).
