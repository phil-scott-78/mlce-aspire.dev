[Azure App Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-app-configuration/) provides a service to centrally manage application settings and feature flags. Modern programs, especially programs running in a cloud, generally have many components that are distributed in nature. Spreading configuration settings across these components can lead to hard-to-troubleshoot errors during an application deployment. The Aspire Azure App Configuration integration enables you to connect to existing App Configuration instances or create new instances all from your AppHost.

In this introduction, you'll see how to install and use the Aspire Azure App Configuration integrations in a simple configuration. If you already have this knowledge, see [Azure App Configuration Hosting integration](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-app-configuration/azure-app-configuration-host) for full reference details.

> [!NOTE]
> To follow this guide, you must have created an Aspire solution to work with. To learn how to do that, see [Build your first Aspire app](/docs/get-started/first-app).

## Set up hosting integration

To begin, install the Aspire Azure App Configuration Hosting integration in your Aspire AppHost project. This integration allows you to create and manage Azure App Configuration resources from your Aspire hosting projects:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AppConfiguration" />

Next, in the AppHost project, create an Azure App Configuration resource and pass it to the consuming client projects:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var appConfig = builder.AddAzureAppConfiguration("config");

builder.AddProject<Projects.WebApplication>("web")
    .WithReference(appConfig);

// After adding all resources, run the app...

builder.Build().Run();
```

> [!CAUTION]
> When you call `AddAzureAppConfiguration`, it implicitly calls
>   `AddAzureProvisioning`—which adds support for generating Azure resources
>   dynamically during app startup. The app must configure the appropriate
>   subscription and location. For more information, see [Local provisioning:
>   Configuration](/integrations/cloud/azure/local-provisioning/#configuration).

## Set up client integration

To get started with the Aspire Azure App Configuration client integration, install the [📦 Aspire.Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration) NuGet package in the client-consuming project:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration" />

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddAzureAppConfiguration` extension method to register the required services:

```csharp title="C# — Program.cs"
builder.AddAzureAppConfiguration(connectionName: "config");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the App Configuration resource in the AppHost project.

You can then retrieve the `IConfiguration` instance using dependency injection:

```csharp title="C# — ExampleService.cs"
public class ExampleService(IConfiguration configuration)
{
    private readonly string _someValue = configuration["SomeKey"];
}
```
