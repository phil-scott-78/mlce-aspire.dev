[Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db/) is a fully managed NoSQL database service for modern app development. The Aspire Azure Cosmos DB integration enables you to connect to existing Cosmos DB instances or create new instances with the Azure Cosmos DB emulator.
</IntegrationIcon>

In this introduction, you'll see how to install and use the Aspire Azure Cosmos DB integrations in a simple configuration. If you already have this knowledge, see [Azure Cosmos DB Hosting integration](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-cosmos-db/azure-cosmos-db-host) and [Azure Cosmos DB Client integration](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-cosmos-db/azure-cosmos-db-client) for full reference details.

> [!NOTE]
> To follow this guide, you must have created an Aspire solution to work with. To learn how to do that, see [Build your first Aspire app](/docs/get-started/first-app).

## Set up hosting integration

To begin, install the Aspire Azure Cosmos DB Hosting integration in your Aspire AppHost project. This integration allows you to create and manage Azure Cosmos DB resources from your Aspire hosting projects:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Hosting.Azure.CosmosDB" />

Next, in the AppHost project, create an Azure Cosmos DB resource and pass it to the consuming client projects:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cosmos = builder.AddAzureCosmosDB("cosmos-db");
var db = cosmos.AddCosmosDatabase("db");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>("api")
    .WithReference(db);

// After adding all resources, run the app...

builder.Build().Run();
```

The preceding code adds an Azure Cosmos DB resource named `cosmos-db` with a database named `db`. The database is then referenced by the `api` project.

## Set up client integration

To get started with the Aspire Microsoft Entity Framework Core Cosmos DB client integration, install the client integration package in the client-consuming project:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos" />

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddCosmosDbContext` extension method to register a `DbContext` for use via the dependency injection container:

```csharp title="C# — Program.cs"
builder.AddCosmosDbContext<MyDbContext>("cosmos-db");
```

### Use injected Azure Cosmos DB properties

In the AppHost, when you used the `WithReference` method to pass an Azure Cosmos DB resource to a consuming client project, Aspire injects several configuration properties that you can use in the consuming project.

Aspire exposes each property as an environment variable named `[RESOURCE]_[PROPERTY]`. For instance, the `Uri` property of a resource called `db` becomes `DB_URI`.

Use the `GetValue()` method to obtain these environment variables in consuming projects:

```csharp title="C# — Obtain configuration properties"
string cosmosUri = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("DB_URI");
string databaseName = builder.Configuration.GetValue<string>("DB_DATABASENAME");
```

> [!TIP]
> The full set of properties that Aspire injects depends on whether you passed an Azure Cosmos DB account, database, or container resource. For more information, see [Properties of the Azure Cosmos DB resources](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-cosmos-db/azure-cosmos-db-client/#properties-of-the-azure-cosmos-db-resources).

## Use Azure Cosmos DB resources in client code

You can then retrieve the `DbContext` instance using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the client from a service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(MyDbContext context)
{
    // Use context...
}
```
