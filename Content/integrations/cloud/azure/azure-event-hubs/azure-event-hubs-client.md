To get started with the Aspire Azure Event Hubs client integration, install the [📦 Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs) NuGet package in the client-consuming project, that is, the project for the application that uses the Event Hubs client.

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs" />

### Supported Event Hubs client types

The following Event Hub clients are supported by the library, along with their corresponding options and settings classes:

| Azure client type                | Azure options class                     | Aspire settings class                              |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `EventHubProducerClient`         | `EventHubProducerClientOptions`         | `AzureMessagingEventHubsProducerSettings`          |
| `EventHubBufferedProducerClient` | `EventHubBufferedProducerClientOptions` | `AzureMessagingEventHubsBufferedProducerSettings`  |
| `EventHubConsumerClient`         | `EventHubConsumerClientOptions`         | `AzureMessagingEventHubsConsumerSettings`          |
| `EventProcessorClient`           | `EventProcessorClientOptions`           | `AzureMessagingEventHubsProcessorSettings`         |
| PartitionReceiver Class          | `PartitionReceiverOptions`              | `AzureMessagingEventHubsPartitionReceiverSettings` |

The client types are from the Azure SDK for .NET, as are the corresponding options classes. The settings classes are provided by Aspire. The settings classes are used to configure the client instances.

### Add an Event Hubs producer client

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddAzureEventHubProducerClient` extension method on any `IHostApplicationBuilder` to register an `EventHubProducerClient` for use via the dependency injection container. The method takes a connection name parameter.

```csharp
builder.AddAzureEventHubProducerClient(connectionName: "event-hubs");
```

> [!TIP]
> The `connectionName` parameter must match the name used when adding the Event
>   Hubs resource in the AppHost project. For more information, see [Add an Azure
>   Event Hubs resource](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-event-hubs/azure-event-hubs-host/#add-an-azure-event-hubs-resource).

After adding the `EventHubProducerClient`, you can retrieve the client instance using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve your data source object from an example service define it as a constructor parameter and ensure the `ExampleService` class is registered with the dependency injection container:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(EventHubProducerClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

For more information, see:

- [Azure.Messaging.EventHubs documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/README.md) for examples on using the `EventHubProducerClient`.
- [Dependency injection in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection) for details on dependency injection.

#### Additional APIs to consider

The client integration provides additional APIs to configure client instances. When you need to register an Event Hubs client, consider the following APIs:

| Azure client type                | Registration API                         |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `EventHubProducerClient`         | `AddAzureEventHubProducerClient`         |
| `EventHubBufferedProducerClient` | `AddAzureEventHubBufferedProducerClient` |
| `EventHubConsumerClient`         | `AddAzureEventHubConsumerClient`         |
| `EventProcessorClient`           | `AddAzureEventProcessorClient`           |
| `PartitionReceiver`              | `AddAzurePartitionReceiverClient`        |

All of the aforementioned APIs include optional parameters to configure the client instances.

## Properties of the Azure Event Hubs resources

When you use the `WithReference` method to pass an Azure Event Hubs resource from the AppHost project to a consuming client project, several properties are available to use in the consuming project.

Aspire exposes each property as an environment variable named `[RESOURCE]_[PROPERTY]`. For instance, the `Uri` property of a resource called `eventhubs` becomes `EVENTHUBS_URI`.

### Azure Event Hubs namespace

The Azure Event Hubs namespace resource exposes the following connection properties:

| Property Name | Description                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Host`        | The namespace hostname                              |
| `Uri`         | The service endpoint URI                            |

In emulator mode, additional properties are available:

| Property Name      | Description                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Host`             | The local emulator host                    |
| `Port`             | The local emulator port                    |
| `Uri`              | The service bus URI                        |
| `ConnectionString` | The full connection string for the emulator |

### Azure Event Hub

The Azure Event Hub resource inherits all properties from its parent namespace and adds:

| Property Name  | Description           |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| `EventHubName` | The Event Hub name    |

### Azure Event Hub consumer group

The Azure Event Hub consumer group resource inherits all properties from its parent hub and adds:

| Property Name       | Description              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `ConsumerGroupName` | The consumer group name  |

For example, if you reference an Event Hub resource named `messages` in your AppHost project, the following environment variables will be available in the consuming project:

- `MESSAGES_HOST`
- `MESSAGES_URI`
- `MESSAGES_EVENTHUBNAME`

### Add keyed Event Hubs producer client

There might be situations where you want to register multiple `EventHubProducerClient` instances with different connection names. To register keyed Event Hubs clients, call the `AddKeyedAzureEventHubProducerClient` method:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedAzureEventHubProducerClient(name: "messages");
builder.AddKeyedAzureEventHubProducerClient(name: "commands");
```

> [!CAUTION]
> When using keyed services, it's expected that your Event Hubs resource
>   configured two named hubs, one for the `messages` and one for the `commands`.

Then you can retrieve the client instances using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the clients from a service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(
    [KeyedService("messages")] EventHubProducerClient messagesClient,
    [KeyedService("commands")] EventHubProducerClient commandsClient)
{
    // Use clients...
}
```

For more information, see [Keyed services in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#keyed-services).

#### Additional keyed APIs to consider

The client integration provides additional APIs to configure keyed client instances. When you need to register a keyed Event Hubs client, consider the following APIs:

| Azure client type                | Registration API                              |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `EventHubProducerClient`         | `AddKeyedAzureEventHubProducerClient`         |
| `EventHubBufferedProducerClient` | `AddKeyedAzureEventHubBufferedProducerClient` |
| `EventHubConsumerClient`         | `AddKeyedAzureEventHubConsumerClient`         |
| `EventProcessorClient`           | `AddKeyedAzureEventProcessorClient`           |
| PartitionReceiver class          | `AddKeyedAzurePartitionReceiverClient`        |

All of the aforementioned APIs include optional parameters to configure the client instances.

### Configuration

The Aspire Azure Event Hubs library provides multiple options to configure the Azure Event Hubs connection based on the requirements and conventions of your project. Either a `FullyQualifiedNamespace` or a `ConnectionString` is required to be supplied.

#### Use a connection string

When using a connection string from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section, provide the name of the connection string when calling `builder.AddAzureEventHubProducerClient()` and other supported Event Hubs clients. In this example, the connection string does not include the `EntityPath` property, so the `EventHubName` property must be set in the settings callback:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureEventHubProducerClient(
    "event-hubs",
    static settings =>
    {
        settings.EventHubName = "MyHub";
    });
```

And then the connection information will be retrieved from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section. Two connection formats are supported:

##### Fully Qualified Namespace (FQN)

The recommended approach is to use a fully qualified namespace, which works with the `Credential` property to establish a connection. If no credential is configured, a [default credential](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-default-credential) is used.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "event-hubs": "{your_namespace}.servicebus.windows.net"
  }
}
```

#### Connection string

Alternatively, use a connection string:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "event-hubs": "Endpoint=sb://mynamespace.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=accesskeyname;SharedAccessKey=accesskey;EntityPath=MyHub"
  }
}
```

### Use configuration providers

The Aspire Azure Event Hubs library supports `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`. It loads the `AzureMessagingEventHubsSettings` and the associated Options, e.g. `EventProcessorClientOptions`, from configuration by using the `Aspire:Azure:Messaging:EventHubs:` key prefix, followed by the name of the specific client in use. For example, consider the `appsettings.json` that configures some of the options for an `EventProcessorClient`:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Messaging": {
        "EventHubs": {
          "EventProcessorClient": {
            "EventHubName": "MyHub",
            "ClientOptions": {
              "Identifier": "PROCESSOR_ID"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For the complete Azure Event Hubs client integration JSON schema, see [Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/ConfigurationSchema.json](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/blob/main/src/Components/Aspire.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/ConfigurationSchema.json).

### Use named configuration

The Aspire Azure Event Hubs library supports named configuration, which allows you to configure multiple instances of the same client type with different settings. The named configuration uses the connection name as a key under the specific client configuration section.

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Messaging": {
        "EventHubs": {
          "EventProcessorClient": {
            "processor1": {
              "EventHubName": "MyHub1",
              "ClientOptions": {
                "Identifier": "PROCESSOR_1"
              }
            },
            "processor2": {
              "EventHubName": "MyHub2",
              "ClientOptions": {
                "Identifier": "PROCESSOR_2"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the `processor1` and `processor2` connection names can be used when calling `AddAzureEventProcessorClient`:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureEventProcessorClient("processor1");
builder.AddAzureEventProcessorClient("processor2");
```

Named configuration takes precedence over the top-level configuration. If both are provided, the settings from the named configuration override the top-level settings.

You can also setup the Options type using the optional `Action<IAzureClientBuilder<EventProcessorClient, EventProcessorClientOptions>> configureClientBuilder` parameter of the `AddAzureEventProcessorClient` method. For example, to set the processor's client ID for this client:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureEventProcessorClient(
    "event-hubs",
    configureClientBuilder: clientBuilder => clientBuilder.ConfigureOptions(
        options => options.Identifier = "PROCESSOR_ID"));
```

### Observability and telemetry

Aspire integrations automatically set up Logging, Tracing, and Metrics configurations, which are sometimes known as _the pillars of observability_. Depending on the backing service, some integrations may only support some of these features. For example, some integrations support logging and tracing, but not metrics. Telemetry features can also be disabled using the techniques presented in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

### Logging

The Aspire Azure Event Hubs integration uses the following log categories:

- `Azure.Core`
- `Azure.Identity`

### Tracing

The Aspire Azure Event Hubs integration will emit the following tracing activities using OpenTelemetry:

- `Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.*`

### Metrics

The Aspire Azure Event Hubs integration currently doesn't support metrics by default due to limitations with the Azure SDK for .NET. If that changes in the future, this section will be updated to reflect those changes.
