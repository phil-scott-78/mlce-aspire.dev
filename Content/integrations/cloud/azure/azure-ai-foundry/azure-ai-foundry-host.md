The Aspire Microsoft Foundry hosting integration models a Microsoft Foundry account as the `FoundryResource` type. To access this type and related APIs in your AppHost project, install the [📦 Aspire.Hosting.Foundry](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Hosting.Foundry) NuGet package:

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Hosting.Foundry" />

> [!NOTE]
> This integration was previously shipped as `Aspire.Hosting.Azure.AIFoundry`.
>   When upgrading from earlier previews, replace that package with
>   `Aspire.Hosting.Foundry`. If your code referenced package-specific Foundry
>   types such as the old `AIFoundryModel`, update those references to
>   `FoundryModel` and add `using Aspire.Hosting.Foundry;` where needed.

For an introduction to working with the Microsoft Foundry hosting integration, see [Get started with the Microsoft Foundry integrations](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-ai-foundry/azure-ai-foundry-get-started).

## Add a Microsoft Foundry resource

To add a Microsoft Foundry resource to your AppHost project, call the `AddFoundry` method providing a name:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("foundry");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
    .WithReference(foundry);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code adds a Microsoft Foundry resource named `foundry` to the AppHost project. The `WithReference` method passes the connection information to the `ExampleProject` project.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you call `AddFoundry`, it implicitly calls `AddAzureProvisioning`—which adds support for generating Azure resources dynamically during app startup. The app must configure the appropriate subscription and location. For more information, see [Local provisioning: Configuration](/integrations/cloud/azure/local-provisioning/#configuration).

## Add a Microsoft Foundry deployment resource

To add a Microsoft Foundry deployment resource, call the `AddDeployment` method with one of the generated `FoundryModel` entries:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("foundry");

var chat = foundry.AddDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.OpenAI.Gpt5Mini);

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
    .WithReference(chat)
    .WaitFor(chat);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

The preceding code:

- Adds a Microsoft Foundry resource named `foundry`.
- Adds a Microsoft Foundry deployment resource named `chat` using the generated `FoundryModel.OpenAI.Gpt5Mini` descriptor.

For more information about the generated model descriptors, see the [FoundryModel API reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/aspire.hosting.foundrymodel).

If you need a different generated model descriptor, use the corresponding nested type, such as `FoundryModel.Microsoft.Phi4Reasoning`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("foundry");

var chat = foundry.AddDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.Microsoft.Phi4Reasoning);

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
    .WithReference(chat)
    .WaitFor(chat);

builder.Build().Run();
```

## Configure deployment properties

You can customize deployment properties using the `WithProperties` method:

```csharp
var chat = foundry.AddDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.OpenAI.Gpt5Mini)
    .WithProperties(deployment =>
    {
        deployment.SkuName = "Standard";
        deployment.SkuCapacity = 10;
    });
```

The preceding code sets the SKU name to `Standard` and capacity to `10` for the deployment.

## Add a Microsoft Foundry project

Use the `AddProject` method to create a Microsoft Foundry project for agents, project-scoped connections, and related Azure resources:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("foundry");
var project = foundry.AddProject("my-project");

var chat = project.AddModelDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.OpenAI.Gpt5Mini);

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>("api")
    .WithReference(project)
    .WithReference(chat)
    .WaitFor(chat);

builder.Build().Run();
```

The preceding code creates a Foundry project and adds a deployment through `AddModelDeployment`. When you call `WithReference(project)`, Aspire injects the standard connection string and project-specific connection properties such as the project endpoint and Application Insights connection string into the consuming resource.

### Configure a Foundry project

You can customize the Azure resources associated with a Foundry project:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("foundry");
var appInsights = builder.AddAzureApplicationInsights("appinsights");
var keyVault = builder.AddAzureKeyVault("keyvault");
var registry = builder.AddAzureContainerRegistry("agents");

var project = foundry.AddProject("my-project")
    .WithAppInsights(appInsights)
    .WithKeyVault(keyVault)
    .WithContainerRegistry(registry);
```

`AddProject` creates a default Azure Container Registry for hosted agents. Use `WithContainerRegistry` when you want to point the project at a different registry.

## Publish a hosted agent to Microsoft Foundry

Use `PublishAsHostedAgent` to publish an executable or containerized app as a hosted agent in a Foundry project:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("foundry");
var project = foundry.AddProject("my-project");
var chat = project.AddModelDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.OpenAI.Gpt5Mini);

builder.AddPythonApp("agent", "..\\agent", "main:app")
    .WithReference(project)
    .WithReference(chat)
    .PublishAsHostedAgent(project);

builder.Build().Run();
```

In run mode, `PublishAsHostedAgent` configures local HTTP, liveness, and readiness endpoints and enables OpenTelemetry output for the agent. In publish mode, Aspire creates an `AzureHostedAgentResource` and publishes the container to the project-associated registry.

If you omit the `project` argument, Aspire uses an existing Foundry project from the app model or creates one automatically.

### Add and publish a prompt agent

For prompt-only scenarios, use `AddAndPublishPromptAgent` on a Foundry project:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("foundry");
var project = foundry.AddProject("my-project");
var chat = project.AddModelDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.OpenAI.Gpt5Mini);

project.AddAndPublishPromptAgent(
    chat,
    "support-agent",
    instructions: "You are a helpful support assistant.");

builder.Build().Run();
```

This creates an `AzurePromptAgentResource` that uses the specified model deployment in the target Foundry project.

## Connect to an existing Microsoft Foundry service

You might have an existing Microsoft Foundry service that you want to connect to. You can chain a call to annotate that your `FoundryResource` is an existing resource:

```csharp
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var existingFoundryName = builder.AddParameter("existingFoundryName");
var existingFoundryResourceGroup = builder.AddParameter("existingFoundryResourceGroup");

var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("foundry")
    .AsExisting(existingFoundryName, existingFoundryResourceGroup);

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
    .WithReference(foundry);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you call `RunAsExisting`, `PublishAsExisting`, or `AsExisting` methods to work with resources that are already present in your Azure subscription, you must add certain configuration values to your AppHost to ensure that Aspire can locate them. The necessary configuration values include **SubscriptionId**, **AllowResourceGroupCreation**, **ResourceGroup**, and **Location**. If you don't set them, "Missing configuration" errors appear in the Aspire dashboard. For more information about how to set them, see [Use existing Azure resources](/integrations/cloud/azure/overview/#use-existing-azure-resources).

## Use Foundry Local for development

Aspire supports the usage of Foundry Local for local development. Add the following to your AppHost project:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("foundry")
    .RunAsFoundryLocal();

var chat = foundry.AddDeployment("chat", FoundryModel.Local.Phi4);

builder.AddProject<Projects.ExampleProject>()
    .WithReference(chat)
    .WaitFor(chat);

// After adding all resources, run the app...
```

When the AppHost starts up, the local foundry service is also started. This requires the local machine to have [Foundry Local](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/foundry-local/get-started) installed and running.

The `RunAsFoundryLocal` method configures the resource to run as an emulator. It downloads and loads the specified models locally. The method provides health checks for the local service and automatically manages the Foundry Local lifecycle.

> [!CAUTION]
> Foundry Projects aren't supported when the parent Foundry resource uses
>   `RunAsFoundryLocal()`. Use account-level deployments for local emulator
>   scenarios.

## Assign roles to resources

You can assign specific roles to resources that need to access the Microsoft Foundry service. Use the `WithRoleAssignments` method:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var foundry = builder.AddFoundry("chat");

builder.AddProject<Projects.Api>("api")
  .WithRoleAssignments(foundry, CognitiveServicesBuiltInRole.CognitiveServicesUser)
  .WithReference(foundry);
```

The preceding code assigns the `CognitiveServicesUser` role to the `api` project, granting it the necessary permissions to access the Microsoft Foundry resource.

## Provisioning-generated Bicep

If you're new to [Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview), it's a domain-specific language for defining Azure resources. With Aspire, you don't need to write Bicep by-hand, instead the provisioning APIs generate Bicep for you. When you publish your app, the generated Bicep provisions a Microsoft Foundry resource with standard defaults.

```bicep title="Generated Bicep — ai-foundry.bicep"
@description('The location for the resource(s) to be deployed.')
param location string = resourceGroup().location

resource ai_foundry 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts@2024-10-01' = {
  name: take('aifoundry-${uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)}', 64)
  location: location
  identity: {
    type: 'SystemAssigned'
  }
  kind: 'AIServices'
  properties: {
    customSubDomainName: toLower(take(concat('ai-foundry', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id)), 24))
    publicNetworkAccess: 'Enabled'
    disableLocalAuth: true
  }
  sku: {
    name: 'S0'
  }
  tags: {
    'aspire-resource-name': 'ai-foundry'
  }
}

resource chat 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/deployments@2024-10-01' = {
  name: 'Phi-4'
  properties: {
    model: {
      format: 'Microsoft'
      name: 'Phi-4'
      version: '1'
    }
  }
  sku: {
    name: 'GlobalStandard'
    capacity: 1
  }
  parent: ai_foundry
}

output aiFoundryApiEndpoint string = ai_foundry.properties.endpoints['AI Foundry API']

output endpoint string = ai_foundry.properties.endpoint

output name string = ai_foundry.name
```

The preceding Bicep is a module that provisions an Azure Cognitive Services resource configured for AI Services. Additionally, role assignments are created for the Azure resource in a separate module:

```bicep title="Generated Bicep — ai-foundry-roles.bicep"
@description('The location for the resource(s) to be deployed.')
param location string = resourceGroup().location

param ai_foundry_outputs_name string

param principalType string

param principalId string

resource ai_foundry 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts@2024-10-01' existing = {
  name: ai_foundry_outputs_name
}

resource ai_foundry_CognitiveServicesUser 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2022-04-01' = {
  name: guid(ai_foundry.id, principalId, subscriptionResourceId('Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions', 'a97b65f3-24c7-4388-baec-2e87135dc908'))
  properties: {
    principalId: principalId
    roleDefinitionId: subscriptionResourceId('Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions', 'a97b65f3-24c7-4388-baec-2e87135dc908')
    principalType: principalType
  }
  scope: ai_foundry
}

resource ai_foundry_CognitiveServicesOpenAIUser 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments@2022-04-01' = {
  name: guid(ai_foundry.id, principalId, subscriptionResourceId('Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions', '5e0bd9bd-7b93-4f28-af87-19fc36ad61bd'))
  properties: {
    principalId: principalId
    roleDefinitionId: subscriptionResourceId('Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions', '5e0bd9bd-7b93-4f28-af87-19fc36ad61bd')
    principalType: principalType
  }
  scope: ai_foundry
}
```

The generated Bicep is a starting point and is influenced by changes to the provisioning infrastructure in C#. Customizations to the Bicep file directly will be overwritten, so make changes through the C# provisioning APIs to ensure they're reflected in the generated files.

### Customize provisioning infrastructure

All Aspire Azure resources are subclasses of the `AzureProvisioningResource` type. This enables customization of the generated Bicep by providing a fluent API to configure the Azure resources—using the `ConfigureInfrastructure` API:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
builder.AddFoundry("foundry")
  .ConfigureInfrastructure(infra =>
  {
      var resources = infra.GetProvisionableResources();
      var account = resources.OfType<CognitiveServicesAccount>().Single();

      account.Sku = new CognitiveServicesSku
      {
          Tier = CognitiveServicesSkuTier.Enterprise,
          Name = "E0"
      };
      account.Tags.Add("ExampleKey", "Example value");
  });
```

The preceding code:

- Chains a call to the `ConfigureInfrastructure` API:
  - The `infra` parameter is an instance of the `AzureResourceInfrastructure` type.
  - The provisionable resources are retrieved by calling the `GetProvisionableResources` method.
  - The single `CognitiveServicesAccount` resource is retrieved.
  - The `Sku` property is assigned to a new instance of `CognitiveServicesSku` with an `E0` name and `Enterprise` tier.
  - A tag is added to the Cognitive Services resource with a key of `ExampleKey` and a value of `Example value`.
