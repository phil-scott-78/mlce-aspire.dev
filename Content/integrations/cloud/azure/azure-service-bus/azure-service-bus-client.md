The Aspire Azure Service Bus client integration is used to connect to an Azure Service Bus service. To get started with the Aspire Azure Service Bus client integration, install the [📦 Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus) NuGet package:
</IntegrationIcon>

<InstallPackage PackageName="Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus" />

For an introduction to working with the Azure Service Bus client integration, see [Get started with the Azure Service Bus integration](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-service-bus/azure-service-bus-get-started).

### Add Service Bus client

In the `Program.cs` file of your client-consuming project, call the `AddAzureServiceBusClient` extension method on any `IHostApplicationBuilder` to register a `ServiceBusClient` for use via the dependency injection container. The method takes a connection name parameter.

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient(connectionName: "messaging");
```

You can then retrieve the `ServiceBusClient` instance using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the connection from an example service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(ServiceBusClient client)
{
    // Use client...
}
```

For more information on dependency injection, see [.NET dependency injection](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection).

### Choose the correct connection name

When you call `AddAzureServiceBusClient()`, the correct value depends on the object you passed to the client in the AppHost.

For example, if you use this code in the AppHost:

```csharp
var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("messaging");

var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.Example_ApiService>("apiservice")
    .WithReference(serviceBus);
```

Then the correct code to add the Service Bus in your client-consuming program is:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient(connectionName: "messaging");
```

However, if you created and passed a Service Bus topic in the AppHost:

```csharp
var serviceBus = builder.AddAzureServiceBus("messaging");
var topic = serviceBus.AddServiceBusTopic("myTopic");

var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.Example_ApiService>("apiservice")
    .WithReference(topic);
```

Then the correct code to add the Service Bus topic in your client-consuming program is:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient(connectionName: "myTopic");
```

For more information, see [Add Azure Service Bus resource](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-service-bus/azure-service-bus-host/#add-azure-service-bus-resource) and [Add Azure Service Bus topic and subscription](/integrations/cloud/azure/azure-service-bus/azure-service-bus-host/#add-azure-service-bus-topic-and-subscription).

## Properties of the Azure Service Bus resources

When you use the `WithReference` method to pass an Azure Service Bus resource from the AppHost project to a consuming client project, several properties are available to use in the consuming project.

Aspire exposes each property as an environment variable named `[RESOURCE]_[PROPERTY]`. For instance, the `Uri` property of a resource called `servicebus` becomes `SERVICEBUS_URI`.

### Azure Service Bus namespace

The Azure Service Bus namespace resource exposes the following connection properties:

| Property Name | Description                |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `Host`        | The namespace hostname     |
| `Uri`         | The service endpoint URI   |

In emulator mode, additional properties are available:

| Property Name      | Description                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Host`             | The local emulator host                    |
| `Port`             | The local emulator port                    |
| `Uri`              | The service bus URI                        |
| `ConnectionString` | The full connection string for the emulator |

### Azure Service Bus queue

The Azure Service Bus queue resource inherits all properties from its parent namespace and adds:

| Property Name | Description        |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| `QueueName`   | The queue name     |

### Azure Service Bus topic

The Azure Service Bus topic resource inherits all properties from its parent namespace and adds:

| Property Name | Description        |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| `TopicName`   | The topic name     |

### Azure Service Bus subscription

The Azure Service Bus subscription resource inherits all properties from its parent topic and adds:

| Property Name      | Description            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| `SubscriptionName` | The subscription name  |

For example, if you reference a queue resource named `queue` in your AppHost project, the following environment variables will be available in the consuming project:

- `QUEUE_HOST`
- `QUEUE_URI`
- `QUEUE_QUEUENAME`

### Add keyed Service Bus client

There might be situations where you want to register multiple `ServiceBusClient` instances with different connection names. To register keyed Service Bus clients, call the `AddKeyedAzureServiceBusClient` method:

```csharp
builder.AddKeyedAzureServiceBusClient(name: "mainBus");
builder.AddKeyedAzureServiceBusClient(name: "loggingBus");
```

> [!CAUTION]
> When using keyed services, it's expected that your Service Bus resource
>   configured two named buses, one for the `mainBus` and one for the
>   `loggingBus`.

Then you can retrieve the `ServiceBusClient` instances using dependency injection. For example, to retrieve the connection from an example service:

```csharp
public class ExampleService(
    [FromKeyedServices("mainBus")] ServiceBusClient mainBusClient,
    [FromKeyedServices("loggingBus")] ServiceBusClient loggingBusClient)
{
    // Use clients...
}
```

For more information on keyed services, see [.NET dependency injection: Keyed services](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection#keyed-services).

### Configuration

The Aspire Azure Service Bus integration provides multiple options to configure the connection based on the requirements and conventions of your project.

#### Use a connection string

When using a connection string from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section, you can provide the name of the connection string when calling the `AddAzureServiceBusClient` method:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient("messaging");
```

Then the connection string is retrieved from the `ConnectionStrings` configuration section:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "messaging": "Endpoint=sb://{namespace}.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName={keyName};SharedAccessKey={key};"
  }
}
```

#### Use configuration providers

The Aspire Azure Service Bus integration supports `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`. It loads the `AzureMessagingServiceBusSettings` from configuration by using the `Aspire:Azure:Messaging:ServiceBus` key. The following snippet is an example of an `appsettings.json` file that configures some of the options:

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Messaging": {
        "ServiceBus": {
          "ConnectionString": "Endpoint=sb://{namespace}.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName={keyName};SharedAccessKey={key};",
          "DisableTracing": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For the complete Service Bus client integration JSON schema, see [Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus/ConfigurationSchema.json](https://github.com/microsoft/aspire/blob/v9.1.0/src/Components/Aspire.Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus/ConfigurationSchema.json).

#### Use named configuration

The Aspire Azure Service Bus integration supports named configuration, which allows you to configure multiple instances of the same resource type with different settings. The named configuration uses the connection name as a key under the main configuration section.

```json
{
  "Aspire": {
    "Azure": {
      "Messaging": {
        "ServiceBus": {
          "bus1": {
            "ConnectionString": "Endpoint=sb://namespace1.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=keyName;SharedAccessKey=key;",
            "DisableTracing": false
          },
          "bus2": {
            "ConnectionString": "Endpoint=sb://namespace2.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=keyName;SharedAccessKey=key;",
            "DisableTracing": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the `bus1` and `bus2` connection names can be used when calling `AddAzureServiceBusClient`:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient("bus1");
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient("bus2");
```

Named configuration takes precedence over the top-level configuration. If both are provided, the settings from the named configuration override the top-level settings.

#### Use inline delegates

You can also pass the `Action<AzureMessagingServiceBusSettings> configureSettings` delegate to set up some or all the options inline, for example to disable tracing from code:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient(
    "messaging",
    static settings => settings.DisableTracing = true);
```

You can also set up the `ServiceBusClientOptions` using the optional `Action<ServiceBusClientOptions> configureClientOptions` parameter of the `AddAzureServiceBusClient` method. For example, to set the `Identifier` user-agent header suffix for all requests issued by this client:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient(
    "messaging",
    configureClientOptions:
        clientOptions => clientOptions.Identifier = "myapp");
```

### Client integration health checks

By default, Aspire integrations enable health checks for all services. For more information, see [Aspire integrations overview](/integrations/overview).

The Aspire Azure Service Bus integration:

- Adds the health check when `DisableTracing` is `false`, which attempts to connect to the Service Bus.
- Integrates with the `/health` HTTP endpoint, which specifies all registered health checks must pass for app to be considered ready to accept traffic.

### Observability and telemetry

Aspire integrations automatically set up Logging, Tracing, and Metrics configurations, which are sometimes known as _the pillars of observability_. Depending on the backing service, some integrations may only support some of these features. For example, some integrations support logging and tracing, but not metrics. Telemetry features can also be disabled using the techniques presented in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

#### Logging

The Aspire Azure Service Bus integration uses the following log categories:

- `Azure.Core`
- `Azure.Identity`
- `Azure-Messaging-ServiceBus`

In addition to getting Azure Service Bus request diagnostics for failed requests, you can configure latency thresholds to determine which successful Azure Service Bus request diagnostics will be logged. The default values are 100 ms for point operations and 500 ms for non point operations.

```csharp
builder.AddAzureServiceBusClient(
    "messaging",
    configureClientOptions:
        clientOptions => {
            clientOptions.ServiceBusClientTelemetryOptions = new()
            {
                ServiceBusThresholdOptions = new()
                {
                    PointOperationLatencyThreshold = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(50),
                    NonPointOperationLatencyThreshold = TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(300)
                }
            };
        });
```

#### Tracing

The Aspire Azure Service Bus integration will emit the following tracing activities using OpenTelemetry:

- `Message`
- `ServiceBusSender.Send`
- `ServiceBusSender.Schedule`
- `ServiceBusSender.Cancel`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.Receive`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.ReceiveDeferred`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.Peek`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.Abandon`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.Complete`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.DeadLetter`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.Defer`
- `ServiceBusReceiver.RenewMessageLock`
- `ServiceBusSessionReceiver.RenewSessionLock`
- `ServiceBusSessionReceiver.GetSessionState`
- `ServiceBusSessionReceiver.SetSessionState`
- `ServiceBusProcessor.ProcessMessage`
- `ServiceBusSessionProcessor.ProcessSessionMessage`
- `ServiceBusRuleManager.CreateRule`
- `ServiceBusRuleManager.DeleteRule`
- `ServiceBusRuleManager.GetRules`

Azure Service Bus tracing is currently in preview, so you must set the experimental switch to ensure traces are emitted.

```csharp
AppContext.SetSwitch("Azure.Experimental.EnableActivitySource", true);
```

For more information, see [Azure Service Bus: Distributed tracing and correlation through Service Bus messaging](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-end-to-end-tracing).

#### Metrics

The Aspire Azure Service Bus integration currently doesn't support metrics by default due to limitations with the Azure SDK.
