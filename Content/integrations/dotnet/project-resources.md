Project resources let a C# AppHost model .NET projects as first-class Aspire resources. Use `AddProject` when you want the AppHost to start, configure, and connect another .NET project through its `.csproj` and `ProjectReference` metadata.
</IntegrationIcon>

## When to use project resources

Use project resources when you need to:

- Orchestrate an ASP.NET Core, worker, or console project from a C# AppHost.
- Reference a project through generated `Projects.*` types instead of hard-coded file paths.
- Reuse launch profile settings and ASP.NET Core endpoint discovery from `launchSettings.json`.
- Connect the project to other Aspire resources with `WithReference`, service discovery, and generated connection strings.

For single-file apps or quick experiments that don't need a `ProjectReference`, use [C# file-based apps](/integrations/dotnet/csharp-file-based-apps) instead.

## Basic workflow

Start by adding a `ProjectReference` from the AppHost to the target project:

```xml title="XML — AppHost.csproj"
<ItemGroup>
  <ProjectReference Include="..\ApiService\ApiService.csproj" />
</ItemGroup>
```

When the AppHost builds, Aspire generates a metadata type in the `Projects` namespace for that reference. Use the generated type with `AddProject`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var api = builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("api");

builder.Build().Run();
```

The path to the project comes from the `ProjectReference`, so `AddProject` doesn't need a `.csproj` path. This is the main difference from `AddCSharpApp`, which points directly to a file, project, or directory.

## Resource dependencies

Project resources participate fully in the Aspire application model. You can reference other resources, flow connection strings and service discovery information, and expose endpoints like any other Aspire resource:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var cache = builder.AddRedis("cache");
var db = builder.AddPostgres("postgres").AddDatabase("appdb");

builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("api")
    .WithReference(cache)
    .WithReference(db)
    .WithExternalHttpEndpoints();

builder.Build().Run();
```

The referenced project receives connection strings and service discovery information through environment variables, just like other Aspire resources.

## Control launch settings and endpoints

Project resources read launch profiles from the target project's _launchSettings.json_ file:

```json title="JSON — launchSettings.json"
{
  "$schema": "http://json.schemastore.org/launchsettings.json",
  "profiles": {
    "http": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5066",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    },
    "https": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:7239;http://localhost:5066",
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use the `launchProfileName` argument when you want a specific profile:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddProject<Projects.InventoryService>(
    "inventoryservice",
    launchProfileName: "https");

builder.Build().Run();
```

The `launchProfileName` argument has the highest precedence. When you don't specify it, Aspire selects the effective launch profile in this order:

1. The explicit `launchProfileName` argument, if supplied.
2. The AppHost default launch profile from `AppHost:DefaultLaunchProfileName` or `DOTNET_LAUNCH_PROFILE`.
3. The first profile in _launchSettings.json_.
4. No launch profile.

To force a project resource to run without a launch profile, pass `launchProfileName: null`:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddProject<Projects.InventoryService>(
    "inventoryservice",
    launchProfileName: null);

builder.Build().Run();
```

For consistency with `dotnet run` and `dotnet watch`, Aspire sets `DOTNET_LAUNCH_PROFILE` on the launched project when an effective launch profile is selected. The selected profile's `environmentVariables` are also passed through to the process.

The `applicationUrl` values in a project's _launchSettings.json_ are the project-resource equivalent of configuring explicit HTTP and HTTPS endpoints:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
builder.AddProject<Projects.Networking_Frontend>("frontend")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 5066)
    .WithHttpsEndpoint(port: 7239);
```

If there's no _launchSettings.json_ file or selected launch profile, project resources don't get HTTP or HTTPS bindings by default.

When you want to ignore launch profile endpoints or prefer Kestrel endpoint configuration, use the `configure` callback.

For ASP.NET Core projects, Aspire can also read endpoint information from Kestrel configuration:

```json title="JSON — appsettings.Development.json"
{
  "Kestrel": {
    "Endpoints": {
      "Https": {
        "Url": "https://*:5271"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With a Kestrel endpoint configured, remove any `applicationUrl` from _launchSettings.json_ before telling the project resource to use Kestrel endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> If both `applicationUrl` and Kestrel endpoint configuration are active, the
>   AppHost throws an exception.

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddProject<Projects.InventoryService>(
    name: "inventoryservice",
    configure: static project =>
    {
        project.ExcludeLaunchProfile = true;
        project.ExcludeKestrelEndpoints = false;
    })
    .WithHttpsEndpoint();
```

For ASP.NET Core projects, Aspire reads the selected launch profile and can create endpoints from the `applicationUrl` field in _launchSettings.json_. You can then customize those endpoints with methods like `WithEndpoint`.

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.AddProject<Projects.InventoryService>("inventoryservice")
    .WithEndpoint("https", endpoint => endpoint.IsProxied = false);
```

## Ports, proxies, and replicas

When you define a host port for a project resource, Aspire assigns that host port to the proxy in front of the project, not directly to the underlying service. This keeps single-instance and replicated projects consistent, and it means `WithReference` consumers use the proxy endpoint from the generated environment variables.

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
builder.AddProject<Projects.Networking_Frontend>("frontend")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 5066)
    .WithReplicas(2);
```

The following diagram shows this setup:

![Aspire frontend app networking diagram with specific host port and two replicas.](/assets/fundamentals/networking/proxy-with-replicas-1x.png)

With that configuration:

- The proxy listens on host port `5066`.
- Each project replica listens on its own random internal port.
- The project receives its internal binding through `ASPNETCORE_URLS`.
- Browsers and dependent resources talk to the proxy endpoint, not directly to a replica.

Without `WithReplicas`, the proxy still fronts the project resource. The host port stays stable, while the project itself listens on a random internal port.

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
builder.AddProject<Projects.Networking_Frontend>("frontend")
    .WithHttpEndpoint(port: 5066);
```

![Aspire frontend app networking diagram with specific host port and random port.](/assets/fundamentals/networking/proxy-host-port-and-random-port-1x.png)

In this configuration:

- The proxy still listens on host port `5066`.
- The project listens on a random internal port.
- `ASPNETCORE_URLS` points the project at the internal port, while browsers and other resources continue to use the stable proxy port.

If you omit the host port entirely, Aspire chooses random host and service ports for the endpoint:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
builder.AddProject<Projects.Networking_Frontend>("frontend")
    .WithHttpEndpoint();
```

![Aspire frontend app networking diagram with random host port and proxy port.](/assets/fundamentals/networking/proxy-with-random-ports-1x.png)

In this configuration, Aspire assigns a random proxy port for the host-facing endpoint and a separate random internal port for the project.

## Filter endpoints in environment variables

Project resource endpoints follow default heuristics. Some endpoints are included in `ASPNETCORE_URLS`, some are published as `HTTP/HTTPS_PORTS`, and some are resolved from Kestrel configuration. Use `WithEndpointsInEnvironment` when you need to filter which endpoints are exposed through environment variables:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
builder.AddProject<Projects.Networking_ApiService>("apiservice")
    .WithHttpsEndpoint()
    .WithHttpsEndpoint(port: 19227, name: "admin")
    .WithEndpointsInEnvironment(
        filter: static endpoint =>
        {
            return endpoint.Name is not "admin";
        });
```

This keeps the `admin` endpoint out of the environment variables while still defining it in the application model.

## How project references work

Project references in the AppHost aren't treated as ordinary build references. Instead, Aspire uses them to create project resource metadata that the AppHost can launch and configure as part of the application model. For the SDK-level build behavior behind this generation step, see [Aspire SDK](/docs/app-host/project-structure/aspire-sdk).

This is what enables the `AddProject<Projects.ApiService>("api")` pattern. The `Projects.ApiService` type is generated from the referenced project during build.

## Exclude a project from orchestration

If you need a regular project reference that shouldn't become an Aspire resource, set `IsAspireProjectResource="false"`:

```xml title="XML — AppHost.csproj"
<ProjectReference Include="..\MyProject\MyProject.csproj" IsAspireProjectResource="false" />
```

## Customize generated project type names

If multiple projects would generate the same `Projects.*` type name, set `AspireProjectMetadataTypeName` on the `ProjectReference`:

```xml title="XML — AppHost.csproj"
<ItemGroup>
  <ProjectReference Include="..\Microservice1\Presentation.Api\Presentation.Api.csproj"
                    AspireProjectMetadataTypeName="MicroService1" />
  <ProjectReference Include="..\Microservice2\Presentation.Api\Presentation.Api.csproj"
                    AspireProjectMetadataTypeName="MicroService2" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Then reference those generated types explicitly:

```csharp title="C# — AppHost.cs"
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var microservice1 = builder.AddProject<Projects.MicroService1>("micro1");
var microservice2 = builder.AddProject<Projects.MicroService2>("micro2");

builder.Build().Run();
```

## AddProject vs. AddCSharpApp

Use `AddProject<T>` when you have a standard `.csproj`, can add a `ProjectReference` from the AppHost, and want generated `Projects.*` types plus launch-profile integration.

Use `AddCSharpApp` when you want to run a single `.cs` file, or when you want to point at a project path directly without adding a `ProjectReference` from the AppHost.

Some .NET app types use specialized integrations instead of `AddProject`. For example, [.NET MAUI integration](/integrations/dotnet/maui) uses `AddMauiProject` because MAUI apps aren't added to the AppHost through `ProjectReference` metadata.
